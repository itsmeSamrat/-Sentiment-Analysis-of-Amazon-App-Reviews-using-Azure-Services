1,"They just updated the app so that when you go to shop and you look up a product it autoplays a video on every. single. product. And when you go to click on the product that you may be interested in, it starts blasting the product video. I was advised there is no way to turn this off unless I also wanted to stop autoplay on my Amazon prime videos. Which means that if I were watching a show it would not autoplay the next episode. I fail to understand why these two would be linked."
3,"I wish the app would work properly, nothing seems to want to load. It keeps freezing and clicking to things when I haven't touched my phone(as I left it alone to let it load). Also keeps exiting me out, hasn't completely crashed, but definitely likes to take me back to home. Nov 16, even after update, still having the same issues. I have to close the app and reopen it to get it to work, everytime I click on something I want to look at or about to buy from my cart. Images don't load, blurry."
1,"It's difficult to find what I'm looking for. There are so many unrelated results, the filters are usually for things I don't care about, and many vendors (especially China-based ones) list innacurate or misleading information. Account settings are a nightnare to navigate; there's not even an option to search the settings (entering search terms in the search bar of the settings screen only returns product results). There doesn't seem to be a way to choose a preferred communication method."
3,"It's hard to find exactly what you're looking for and sometimes it excludes results for some reason. Heaven forbid you try and move something from one list to another or delete something off a list. Everytime I try the app immediately stalls and quits working within a few minutes. I never get more than 7 things deleted at a time. The only good thing about it is I've never had issues with orders. They arrive within the projected time. Website works well, app is extremely buggy."
1,"Horrible algorithm, you have to know exactly how to search to find what you want, and your home page will be filled with the most useless items for you. It crashes, loads slow, bugs, and is generally inconvenient. Also they keep updating what the app looks like and every time it gets uglier and more inconvenient. The orders page has changed so my past orders and current are all combined and mixed making my orders extremely hard to visualize."
1,"Stale app. Sadly, does not support dark mode. Search is poor showing many irrelevant results. Order history has been shortened to 3 months from having a complete history. Having a full history to scroll through was very helpful in finding items to re-order and to see when items were purchased for warranty. Now you have to filter by year. If you cannot remember what year it was, it's much more difficult to search. Less useful. Handling of missing orders sucks. November 2022 - no improvements."
2,"The wish list feature is almost unusable. For months now it has been near impossible to scroll, with the list constantly snapping back to the top. Editing comments and priorities is actually impossible, and almost if not always ends with the app crashing. For a store that's entirely web based, this is pretty embarrassing."
2,"Useful but broken. The 'my orders' screen does not load a majority of the time, it just gets stuck / frozen. This makes reordering items, handling returns, checking order status, and sharing product links all much more difficult than it has to be. It's been broken for months, and I've reported the bug previously with no response. I place many more orders than most people probably, which may be why I have the problem. FYI there is a workaround, you can go to 'buy again' and search for the order"
1,"Since the new update, I'm asked repeatedly in a small time frame to verify that I'm not a bot. Then completely glitches even after I verify. Viewing/tapping anything n editing Wishlists leads to the same ""Something Went Wrong On Our End"" message for the next 15-30 minutes. App is now impossible to use. Constant error messages when saving to a wishlist, glitchy misclicks (clicks items on even on screen) and very slow response when tapping Add to List. Will be uninstalling until further notice."
1,Horrible algo for filters. The results are unrelated. The filters don't even work. You apply a filter for a price range and it shows products higher or lower too. The filters sucks and makes it so hard to navigate and look for a desired product. I don't understand why Amazon can't work on this feature and make it smooth and useful for the user.
1,"Horrible app. I never had problems before this new revised app. I actually have had to go to the web page instead to do certain things. For example, I need to enter a new payment method and it freezes OR goes to a page that wants my address (???!????) And also a clothing size I wanted was on the web page but not on the app. All my devices are having problems with this app."
4,"Guys, can you make a feature: automatic classification of goods added to shopping lists, and then you can quickly view a list of goods of any class (clothes, cosmetics, children's toys, etc.). As for the UI, it can be implemented as a filter, but it is better as a list of product classes (with icons) and placed, for example, in a new tab in the ""List & Registry""."
1,"The app works okay for now. However, based on the experience with Amazon removing functionality and charging extra for it (like they did with Photos, and now in Nov 2022 with Music). Simple things like playing a specific song now cost extra, it will only play songs ""similar"" to for the fee we already pay. Expect bad decisions like this to come to the Amazon shopping app."
1,"This app is GARAGE!!! For weeks now I have been struggling with the app freezing, flashing and crashing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it and the problem still exists. I have been going to the Walmart app and others to do my shopping. I guess this is what happens when you're not a Prime member, but have shopped with Amazon for over 20 years 😠😠😠"
2,"Stop asking me to enable Alexa. I don't want to use Alexa, and there's no way to turn off the CONSTANT reminders that it's not enabled. The app is OK for quick orders, but being nagged every ten seconds to enable a service I DON'T WANT is annoying. Navigation within the app is not intuitive, and Amazon keeps moving things, so as soon as you figure out where to find something (like your gift card balance), it changes and you're right back to square one. The website is not much better."
1,"I love Amazon but this app needs A LOT of work. It freezes every few seconds the ENTIRE time I try using it. It makes me not even want to shop because it take hours to get anything to load and especially when you are trying to read reviews and look at customers pictures with their review. It is impossible to shop around with it crashing and freezing every few seconds. The updates are making it worse each time. Now I keep getting an ""Amazon is not responding"" message and kicks me out repeatedly."
1,"Ever since the new update, the app will randomly shut down, freeze, lag, and cause me to restart my phone. I can't make two clicks without an issue. This is horribly frustrating. The app is up to date, I've cleared the cache multiple times. I've restarted my phone countless times. I have never been this frustrated with this app. PLEASE FIX IT."
1,"Scrolling for an item can be absolutely miserable with the unpausble video ads. Sure you can mute/scroll past them but the shakey camera they use for half of the products makes me physically ill. Having the the screen scroll downward while a video shakes around on the screen the perfect recipe for motion sickness. Got to the point where I've given up on searching for certain items where I'm more likely to be shown these ads. Honestly, Prime cost to much to have to put up with this."
1,"This has always been one of the more sluggish and unresponsive apps I regularly use, but after the latest update, the app now freezes my phone up if I add an item to a list or execute any action other than searching and browsing items. If I try to go home or switch to a different app, I am taken back to the Amazon page I was on when the glitch occurred, as if it is the new Home screen. The only way to escape is to reboot my phone when it happens."
1,"Extremely frustrating. It lags and it is absolutely terribly slow. When you go to heart something you're not provided an option for which list you would like that item to be put into so you have to then go in and manually move everything, but it takes FOREVER to do so. The least you could do is offer a mass selection. This has been going on for a very long time, as in years and I figured maybe they'll fix it but you guys never have. I've tried everything to fix it and nothing works. So over it."
1,"This new update has made the app terrible as far as user friendly. You can no longer quickly check what has shipped, lists or any shortcut that was previously found with the 3 lines at the bottom of the page. Now it is a bunch of useless stuff that I will never use. Order history (when I could find it) has been reduced to 3 months. I pay for ""prime"" but that's just a term. Shipping is just whenever, and free returns is only if you get lucky. Sort by price is a joke."
3,"I don't experience a lot of crashing, but I do experience freezing and extended loading times (upwards of 30 seconds) pretty regularly. I'd like to be able to customize my home feed, because I am ZERO PERCENT interested in most of that content. Especially livestreams, which is a laughable concept to me. It's messy, cluttered and becoming a backwards app."
2,"The app crashes way too often. No exaggeration...every time I try to edit items on my wishlist, the app freezes and shuts down. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. I've restarted my phone. I've made sure to update the app every time an update is available. It's very annoying. I love Amazon. I'd say the app is very convenient, but not when it crashes all the time."
2,"What on earth did you do to this app?! The new search filters are absolute trash. It is so much more difficult to narrow things down properly, and everything is much more broad. Example: Men's Pants for fit type there is now only straight, loose, fitted. Where is the athletic, slim, bootcut, etc etc. Also the whole left/right column look just really doesn't look good at all. Though the old version did have some flaws, it was way better than this UI. You could have just improved on what you had!"
1,"This app has gone from functional to barely functioning over the last few months. It used to run fine, but now it takes forever to load, and it's always erroring and unable to load. Absolute hot garbage. It's supposed to be convenient, but is only frustrating because of how poorly it works, when it works. Even with a strong WiFi connection, it's unable to connect and load anything."
3,"I can usually find what I'm looking for at a reasonable price. I don't like that it gives you one price on shipping, which may change on checkout. I also don't like that it will give you a delivery date, that becomes a different delivery date, only after you have completed your order and checkout! Amazon also doesn't give enough options for bad reviews, leaving the blame to anyone else, giving themselves a scapegoat for having to replace an item."
3,"The amount of content in terms of videos and ads is high. It used to be relatively fast. Shopping was an easy experience. Over the years, it's become bloated, and much less convenient. In terms of usability, finding account options ranges from easy to ridiculously difficult. There's a sea of menus, with what seems like hundreds of options buried in them. It would be a huge improvement if Amazon were to simplify and streamlined account options."
1,"So many issues with this app and it seems to get worse with every update. I don't know what is going on with the people updating this app, but what you're doing is making me want to just get rid of Amazon all together. Example: moving stuff in my list, the app crashes, freezes and puts items in other lists. Searching for items, the app crashes as well. The searches are not consistent with the results and trying to filter the search eliminates items that shouldn't be."
1,"A genuinely annoying app. Everything wants to open in it but the features are so bad it's barely usable. Take the lists for example: you cannot move placement of items in your list in the app. You can't view people's other attached lists (or even see that they have them) either. Basically all the ""desktop"" features are missing and inaccessible. Its inconvenient."
2,"Works pretty well, easy to navigate order history. It mixes in random items in searches, and will make some items harder to find. Need to add a way to turn off the video preview, I want pictures not videos of items I'm scrolling through. They make the app much slower."
1,"Unfortunately I have to write my first negative experience of Amazon. Long story short I found a promotion that showed up online and in the app. I put the items in my cart that matched the terms of the promotion, did not apply. So I chatted with customer service who assured me how to fix this problem, then randomly got told I needed a call back. So I did that, and after an hour of transfers, the promotion page magically said this is no longer available. I am beyond disappointed and frustrated."
1,"In order to use the app, you are forced to view a full screen ad which you can't close. I know it's a shopping app but the ads were already ridiculous. I've turned off all notifications to keep the ads away, but now every time I open the app, it's a full page ad, that you can't escape, shown for a moment before you are allowed to use the app."
1,"I have really been having a hard time with Amazon here lately. The shipping has been absolutely atrocious. They also make it impossible to leave feedback about anything. Now they've also blocked the talk to text option on everything. I use that constantly.... It's the only app it won't work on. I'm not sure why. Honestly, it's so corporate, It's impossible to get help if it doesn't just work perfectly for you."
1,"The latest update made searching for specific items difficult! I tried to give it a few weeks and see if i just needed time to get used to it, but no it does suck! Search results are broad and fairly unrelated to what I'm actually searching for. Trying the filter isn't much help either. Trying to filter by brand still shows cheap knock-offs an look-alikes. Trying to filter by price range shows expensive look-alikes and SPONSORED items, like you're trying to HIDE the items i actually want to buy!"
1,"Ever since the update about a month ago this is the worst app ever, and so frustrating. Ridiculously slow. I could go to my computer and log in before this app loads its pages. Buttons have been moved to the bottom, which is not a big deal, but that's when the app somehow got really slow. Alexa button is always present and in the way even if you've disabled alexa. I've already switched to other stores for shopping, solely because it's no longer easy to shop Amazon with the new app versions."
3,"Quick shopping, right at your finger tips! I love Amazon! Fast shipping, great variety, available anytime. App does well & doesn't crash. Can we please get a dark mode setting to ease the light on our eyes from the screen? Also, can a higher version of the app be designed? I have a phone with a smaller RAM & limited storage space so it would be super helpful!"
1,"Suddenly in Android 13 the app is always running and doesn't need to be. I AM capable of tapping an icon to start an app in case you were confused about that. Visually unappealing. Bottom menus are not intuitive, a roadblock to use and difficult to access for many people with joint issues in their fingers. So thanks for making an app with a terrible color scheme that is literally physically painful to use."
4,"A couple weeks ago the app randomly changed to Spanish and I have to switch it back to English every time I open it, but it only changes some pages. Now I have to look up how to get it off my phone because the normal way doesn't work. Update: switching to a previous version fixed it. If it's not broken, don't ""fix"" it. Edit: So it's been a few months and I've been forced to update the app. It's much more difficult to navigate. I still can't manage my Kindle content on it or see my KU list. 😟"
1,"Delivery Notifications no longer work. I used to get a notification when a package was delivered, but now I get nothing. I have verified that all notification settings are enabled in the app, as well as my device settings. Delivery Notifications are the biggest reason I have this app installed. If they don't fix this soon, there's no reason for me to keep the app."
1,"Since the update the app says my address fors not exist and I had to change the address. I called customer service and it wasn't showing on their end, even tho I have had things delivered to my residence forever. Had to update the billing address, and then change it back. It's correct on one screen and not the other. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and placed the order, but I have no idea if the payment will go thru because the billing addresses are different on the screens."
1,"Carefully designed with a lack of filters so there's no barrier between you and an impulse purchase. I want to filter out all products made in China and I want to see clothes made from sustainable materials. Different variations of the same exact product spam search pages, zero transparency of products or companies and counterfeit personal care products run rampant. I would love to see Amazon become more ethical and transparent."
1,"Why a company with as many resources and as technologically advanced as Amazon can't develop a decent app-shopping experience boggles my mind. Over the 6-7 years that I've been using this app, it becomes less user friendly and more susceptible to problems with every update. The damn thing only remains stable & usable for about 1 minute before it freezes...every time. I would be embarrassed to be this apps developer(s)!"
1,"Very inconsistent app. that won't load anything. It often opens but just shows a blan white page that is loading something but never actually loads anything. More often than not i won't let me view my orders or lists. Frequently crashes or freezes on me. It will often not respond then magically respond to several ""clicks"" and almost place an order for something I've never looked at. UPDATE: Dropped to 1 star because the app doesn't work 90% of the time!! 10-20 attempts to get the app to work!!"
2,"Edit 2022: i used to get shipping/delivery notifications (which i want). Now i also get ads (which i don't want). Looks like you can either turn on notifications which gives you both kind, or turn off and lose the important notifications about deliveries. That sucks. Edit 2020: Strange. Searching in the Amazon app now has the Previous and Next buttons instead of continuous scrolling. Looks like we stepped 3 years back in time?"
2,Changes shipping address without you selecting it on the order confirmation if you try viewing your saved addresses. When trying to find books the kindle version keeps popping up. You can only find physical copies on the same page as a the kindle so its easy to miss. Workbooks and Study guides keep popping up instead of the regular version of books when you swap between hard and paperback copies. Having all versions of the same book on one page is a nuisance when you can't tell them apart.
2,"Buggy and limited. It's nice to have access to Amazon from my phone, but the webapp used lacks a lot of the features you find on the site (which is silly since this is mostly just a frameview for the website and not a full featured app). It sometimes overflows outside of the view window so scrolling gets really weird since it'll move a bit to the left and right, constant error messages where something went wrong, filters in searches are sometimes broken, and lots more issues, it's just a mess."
1,"Lots of misleading products in the search results. Example: In results, a product is listed at $53, but when you click to go to the product page, it's actually listed for $153. And most of the search results aren't even close to what you're looking for. Example: You search for ""rain boots"" and the first 10 products listed are leather boots that aren't even waterproof. Wondering if they're ever going to fix this bc between those 2 issues and constantly pushing low-rated products, this app sucks"
2,"If Amazon changed the developers for this last update 😭, please switch back. The app is not functioning properly. I barely got to checkout & I searched for ""x"" then remembered I needed to remove something from my cart and it kept bringing me back to the search page. when I searched for ""y"" it still gave me the ""x"" search. Please make the Amazon app functional again. Amazon has always been a love of mine. However, in the midst of hurricane Ian when I needed ease it only frustrated me."
3,The amazin app is great and I appreciate that I can use the service on my phone so well. The thing that annoys me are wish lists. You aren't able to select multiple items if you want to move more than one thing to another list. So you have to go through item by item to move them BUT it shoots you back up to the very top of the wish list. Scrolling back down to where you left off (and the placeholder not being automatically removed after you've moved an item) is pretty annoying after a while.
1,"Getting worse and worse. I've been an Amazon customer for a long time but I'm looking at other options including Walmart. Every other search result is a sponsored ad now. Autoplay ads that can't be shut off. The user experience, both app and website, is beyond infuriating.I've read a lot of similar complaints. Clearly Amazon does not care what their customers think. How about letting customers opt out of advertising for a few bucks more each month on our Amazon Prime subscriptions?"
1,"This app was wonderful without any issues before this recent update. I can't filter search items from low to high as every item and its prices are randomized. Also, it keeps glitching for every action. It's always failing to search anything, to look at a item I press, and even to checkout. Its gotten so frustrating to the point where I haven't bought anything from Amazon these past two weeks. I've decided to get a Walmart plus membership and buy the items I need from there."
1,"The latest update puts advertisements that play for several seconds when opening the app for stupid Amazon shows I will never watch. Then, I can't open my shopping cart... every time I try to go to my cart to check out, it goes to my previous search results page instead. I'm so frustrated with the app experience because it just shows how Amazon is behaving as a business, faulty app updates that ruin customer experience just for the sake of ad revenue. I might cancel my entire Prime subscription."
3,"I honestly spend an exceeding amount of time and money on this app. It has everything I need and more. I only wish it were easier to manage lists and move items to new lists. It is hard to organize when the app scrolls all the way back to the beginning of the list each time an item is moved. I hope they develop a feature where you can select multiple items and move them all at once, or at least save your place on the page."
1,"The app has worked fine for some time, and all of a sudden today it won't let me log in, I can't search my order history, nothing seems to be working. I tried clearing the app data and cache, tried uninstall and reinstalling, the app is just flat out refusing to work and gives me an error about my internet connection, even though I can access my Amazon account on my phone web browser just fine. What happened Amazon?"
4,"Very nice experience, but a laptop for this kind of shopping is clearly superior. The app is nice for a quick item or two and great for music and movies, but if you're planning on a deep dive or any real heavy lifting on the aite, you're better off with a device with a bigger screen. Scrolling just isn't going to cut it. Nice for a quick purchase that comes to mind! Mind your data limits!"
2,"I actually love this app and haven't had problems until last week when the app started to crash on me and now it crashes consistently in 30 seconds of trying to find a product. Please fix because I can't use the app like this. To be specific, it crashes if I search for a product and scroll down a bit and many times if I try to tap into a product it crashes."
1,"Until this last update I have had zero issues with this app. However now, even after clearing cache, data, uninstalling and reinstalling, the app will not allow me to access my account information, has lost my saved addresses and so on. Normally this wouldn't bother me however being able to make orders on the fly while traveling or st work etc is the one major convenience this app offers. Its quite redundant without it. Please fix this. No point to the app if its only fully functional on my PC."
2,"Terribly wasteful with data usage, and the app has distracting autoplay videos that can't be disabled. (Even *Facebook* recognizes this is an accessibility problem.) It performs some basic tasks, but Amazon has confused ""Shopping"" with ""intrusive billboard"". The in-app navigation is also a catastrophe: ""Back"" doesn't remember where you were, so every page change means scrolling through several screens. No tabs. Advertised real-time tracking doesn't actually exist."
1,"Advertisements are starting to become extremely intrusive. When LOTR tv show came out, an Amazon advertisement would overlay on top of the screen and made you wait several seconds before allowing you to access the app. Today, 9/14/22, they sent me a push notification to advertise a football game to stream. There isnt any way to disable this without disabling the useful ""your package is 10 stops away"" notifications. Dystopian. We are getting closer to that black mirror episode every day."
2,"9/21/22 update. It STILL won't load order screen. I'm ready to not use this app anymore. It's THAT ANNOYING. Won't load orders screen. Ever. For about a month now I haven't been able to look at my orders. I can log into my email and see if they've been shipped but the app won't let me see them. It just tries to load and starts again, etc etc. Please fix it."
3,"Forces you to use the app even though you can't buy digital content in the app anymore. Example: you can't buy ebooks in the app anymore. But if you try to search for an ebook in your browser, the app somehow takes over and forces itself open where there's no option to buy the book. I might be able to work with this if the browser search would execute simultaneously, but going back to the browser just leaves you on the homepage. Tap search and the app forces open again.... And again."
1,"I had 4 orders cancelled in the past week and a half. Ordering is no longer reliable. So much time wasted. I don't recommend Amazon delivery at all. Now delivery drivers are not supplying tracking map for orders until AFTER delivery. Also, some items on list page are advertised as lower prices then they actually are. Amazon doesn't enforce accuracy. To me it's fraud."
4,"Great app, I use it often. But it keeps defaulting to Spanish, and then I have to navigate an app in a language I don't speak to switch it back to English. I find out when I'm emailed about my order in Spanish. My app settings and phone settings are both set to the United States region, I don't use a VPN. The website never changes, it's always in English. This is strictly an app issue. So this is worth losing a star for me."
1,"It's as if they're trying to make the app terrible. The menu button opens a drawer containing ""shortcuts"" that takes up 2/5 of the screen. Scrolling through lists often won't work. List sorting doesn't always work. AmazonSmile sounds nice but won't work unles I subject myself to ad notifications. There is now a video on the main that auto-plays. How much of my data allotment does that use?"
5,"The app was not perfect but pretty good years ago when my wife & I 1st started using it. By now (10-2022) it has improved. It loads faster & is more likely to open without issue when using links, whether text or Google result portals. ( Although, it may have been my device causing this issue, I'm not certain. I've switched to a different phone ). It's nice that when searching a specific brand or item, you are shown alternatives at alternate price points & shipping options. I would recommend 👌"
2,"Very slow to open, but otherwise pretty functional. I would expect a pretty immediate response from opening the app, but my lists, cart and menu area all take over 45 seconds just to bring up text, let alone images. Unacceptable, in this age of speed and convenience (admittedly first world problems, but Amazon should be big enough to fix this post haste.)"
4,"Ok, the only issue that I have with this app is the list view. The first item is pushed out to the left(difficult visibility) due to misplaced "" list option view"" on the screen, whenever I check/view my list. Like, will one of the developers fix this bug please! I wasn't going to say anything, but it's been this way for a LONG time now and drives me 🥴. Maybe it's my ocd 🤷🏾‍♂️ if I could've post a photo for better understanding, then I would have. Sorry. 😧"
4,"Shopping experience is great but something is broken in your code. When I'm in my cart and I swipe from right to left to save an item for later, the entire UI below the light blue delivery info bar shifts and pushes the contents directly into the very left side of my screen. This doesn't happen when I swipe the other way around. It's like the left side padding ceases the exist and it's very odd. I though maybe I needed to update the app and I did so.....issue is still there though."
2,"This app is only good for tracking shipments. Browsing Amazon is so much easier on an actual browser with tabs. On devices with larger screens (ZFold 4) the experience is horrible, the app is not able to take advantage of screen real estate, just blowing up the UI in size instead of allowing you to see more info. Lack of tabbed browsing, and poor usage of higher screen resolution make this app very unuseful for shopping."
1,Placed an order that never came. Received an email stating it had been returned. Went to reorder the item; I put the item in the cart & it read 'get a $15 coupon if you order this through the app'. I click the button to get the app. The app downloads. There is no coupon. I go back to the email that lead me to the coupon & click again; it reads 'you've already received this coupon '. IVE RECEIVED NOTHING. So beyond frustrated with this whole ordeal.
3,"No way to flag fake items, report scalping, counterfeit items, potential brushing scams, or even correct items that are listed in the wrong category, example: dietary supplements in the Bathing Accessories section. Also, too many items have insanely long item names. It's past time to start cracking down on those. That's what the description is for!"
3,"Have used Amazon Prime for over 10years and has always been a very beneficial app with prime shipping, music, video, and audible all included. However recently in the event that there is an issue that needs to be resolved through customer service the process has never been more frustrating and confusing. I have emailed twice now about why my account is unable to submit reviews or review videos as I was wanting to leave a beneficial detailed review on a recently purchased product and no response."
2,"The app used to run fine...over the last month or so it simply will not load. I have waited and waited and get nothing. I close the app and restart it to try again and still...nothing. The only thing it loads is the home page and if you shop from there it works 80% of the time. If I search something it will eventually pull up a list as well. But if I try to go to my menu where I can go to my account, prime, outlet, etc...It will not load. I am so frustrated with it! Fix it! Fix it, please!!"
1,"Full screen non-skippable ads when you launch the app are the worst! I'm opening your app to buy things and give you money. You don't need to make that harder with annoying ads. If anything it makes hate the thing in the ad and want to use this app less. Also please let me disable the videos inside the app. They eat up data, are annoying, and way to easy to accidently click on them scrolling through the app. Just make it easy for me to get into the app and give you money. How hard is that?"
2,"Amazon just made their app worse...again. Now you have to dig for your order history & tracking. ""My Orders"" used to be the 1st icon on the shortcut tab (bottom right). Now it is buried at the bottom of a very long list of Amazon junk I'm not interested in. And the shortcuts are advertisements - again, for Amazon junk I don't care about and rarely use (Today's Deals, Prime Reading, etc)."
1,"The only way to buy items is to put them in your cart, you can no longer buy it with a button click. Ads will block parts of your screen and it freezes constantly. Have to exit the app and shut it down then reopen it to deal with the freezes. Even cleared the cache and undid the updates, it did not work at all. Now it will only notify me in Spanish despite not being the set language on my device. Tried time fix it but it is stuck on that language."
5,"I use amazon for everything and the app makes it possible! It has Alex built in which can be annoying for some (like me). You can easily get customer support through the app via phone call or message....no waiting on hold. You can even track your driver in route. Sometimes figuring out what you need, and where to go to get it can be confusing and illogical to me, but you can always use help and ""search"""
2,"Really hate the new filter search layout. There was no reason to change it. Still can't filter specific prices, still stuck using preset ranges. Still can't filter results for only warehouse. If you're going to make changes, at least do something useful"
1,"Amazon as a whole has been getting worse for quite a while now, but whatever they've done to the app recently is over the top. If it's not glitching and kicking me out, then it just isn't running at all. Won't open or load anything. It used to be so easy to use, now it's just a headache. I really used to like Amazon, but I'm seriously considering just quitting it altogether."
1,"The app is buggy and Amazon does nothing to address the issues. I constantly have to force the app to stop, clear the cache, power down my phone, and then power it in again (not restart) if I want to view my orders. Otherwise I get nothing and my orders will not show up, or I maythe stupid dog picture with the ""Oops"" screen. This renders the app virtually useless because one has to check on one's orders since Amazon fails to deliver on time if even at all so frequently these days."
1,"Constantly being charged for items I already returned; so I always have to chat with Cust Srvc in the app. I can no longer access those chats! They automatically bump you out and seemingly remove the chat from your view. This is just ONE of MANY reasons why I canceled Prime and have started using Target & Walmart apps more frequently. Search & filter functions are ridiculously inaccurate- not helpful! And once you try to sort by price, half of the applicable results disappear."
2,"This app lost one star just now because of the 20 reviews I read, not one has a response from the developers. And every one was negative with less than half being positive as well. I haven't used the app much in the past year but when I have I liked the new search filters alot. What I do not like is getting messages that the apps microphone is running in the background. Call me crazy but shouldn't the mic only be on while I'm using the app?? Makes me 🤮🤮."
1,"App now shows an add on every start up, even if you pay for prime, and most prime items still aren't 2 day shipping. The search still isn't very good (often get partial matches well before the full search match you are looking for, items out of price order due to scam, used, or other size options, and numerous other problems,) and the reviews are often obvious fakes or sometimes for a different product."
1,"So why is ""color"" not a filter? Looking for something in one color? Fine; type it out. Then change your mind, type another 40 something colors because you aren't sure what you want. And if that's not enough; you put put every other color up on the search results. 😕 I hate this so much. I wish there was a negative star button on here. Google is more helpful than you. 🙄 blue is not pink, nor is lipstick eyeshadow..."
1,"REALLY hating the unskippable Prime Early Access Sale animation that I'm forced to watch every time I open the gd app. I also keep getting the ""reload $100 and get an extra $10"" offer that's only available if it's your first time reloading, but there's no way of checking whether you're eligible without just reloading $100 and hoping. I can't afford to essentially give Amazon a $100 advance in HOPES of getting an extra $10, even if I will spend it all EVENTUALLY."
2,"When you search for something, let's say ""long black dress"", instead if leaving the thumbnails as still-pictures, it auto-plays a video of the model wearing the dress before you even click on it. Several times it's not even the same dress in the picture. Like, for less than a second it was a long plain black dress with a V-neck and suddenly now there's a model spinning in a short, frilly, flowery dress. Just show me the front of the dress and if I like it I'll click on it for more."
2,"The app has gotten buggy. More than Half the time i can't access my orders. The app itself has also disappeared from my list of apps but is still showing installed. Update 7/22/22-- now i can't even add items to my wishlists without ""encountering an error. "" i decided to add the item to my shopping cart but got the ""dog"" error. This is ridiculous. Update: nearly 3 months later the option to view my orders is still messed up. Screen just blinks. FIX IT AMAZON."
2,"A lot of times the app gets confused and sends you to a page that says oops something went wrong and then you have to go back to the homepage to start over again, happens a lot! Also recently purchased a bike bag that was to come with a lock. Order arrived no lock in package customer service could only give me a credit for the lock but was only good towards Amazon's own products, therefore I can never use that credit unless I buy an Amazon product excluding all other sellers, BOGUS!!!"
3,"The new update is killing the app. I shop on Amazon almost daily and I loved having the cart, home, and settings up top. When I look at a webpage, do I want to see it upside down? It's frustrating and I'm finding myself getting frustrated now and exiting without buying anything. I asked my friends and sisters, they all feel the same. Change the app back Amazon!! - Update 10-08-22 They did it again! I want to access my orders on the main page, now you have to go through hoops to find them!"
2,"The shopping experience on Amazon continues to deteriorate. Amazon is trying too aggressively to tell my preferences, so it just won't show all that is available. Plus the same item comes up over and over from different sellers. Additionally half of all *l""results"" are sponsored ads. I am no longer shopping around in the app or on the site. It's a frustrating waste of time to find what you are looking for. Plus there are endless products that don't match images or descriptions. Amazon is dying."
2,"Loved it until a couple of weeks ago when suddenly everything is now in Spanish instead of English! I have to keep tapping ""Translate"" for each page, even though I have my settings on ENGLISH. Even my order confirmation email was in Spanish! I've tried several times to get them to correct it, but with no success. I'm SO frustrated with this, and VERY disappointed in what had been a wonderful app...especially since I'm disabled and need to use Amazon for most of my shopping."
3,"I have a love hate relationship with this app and Amazon in general. The convenience is definitely nice and there are features I really like, but it is like the wild west when trying to find legit and decent priced items. I get the run around a lot when trying to solve issues too and that's super frustrating. I didn't get a refund back on an item that was damaged in transit and returned to Amazon. I tried to resolve the issue and just got the run around by the automated helper. So annoying."
4,"I love amazon. It's my go to for everything. From clothing to art supplies to electronics to food. It really has something for everyone . I only wish that the preference for how items searched for are listed could be personalized. I hate having to click the filter and select priced low to high EVERY time I search. Another complaint is my phone only lets me view, maybe 8 items a page. It is very time consuming."
1,"Watch/delete your payment methods you have saved on your Amazon Prime account/wallet. They have made it a habit to charge a saved account a small, random amount of money, and call it an ""authorization charge"" for an order, even though the account charged wasn't the account used to place the order, AND the order had already been paid for, shipped, and received over a week ago. This makes twice now for me. They think they are being sneaky!"
1,"It was great, I used it all the time for buying things I can't get locally. Even subed to prime for quite a while. Then several items I ordered were delivered to the wrong addresses. Tracking showed that someone requested to have the address changed to one in NJ or NYC. I tried calling the shipper and they refused to change it back. Amazon refunded me, but then my debit card info was stolen. My bank was able to find who used it, and let me know that they got it from my Amazon account."
2,"It's usually a great app with infinite items to choose from at usually competitive prices. Biggest issue for me is when a product has options for multiple features (i.e. color, size, etc.), one drop down list will open but I cannot select an option. The second or third drop down won't even open at all."
2,"Not Great. I liked Amazon at first but now they have multiple items listed for WAY over actual value, the filters don't work well at all and in my household alone there have been SIX packages gone ""missing,"" in the last 30 days. It's insane. I can't believe that many items could go missing like that, I am starting to lose all faith/interest in Amazon."
2,"When it works it works well but I have to give it 2 stars because it periodically needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to work properly. One day I'll open the app and all my data is gone, wish list, history, gift card balance, etc. I can see that stuff fine if I log in using my PC, but that defeats the purpose of having the app. Tried restarting my phone, force stopping, nothing works so it has to be reinstalled to finally retrieve my data."
1,"An app from one of the biggest tech companies ever should not be this unstable. It's constantly timing out or failing to connect or throwing some random error that it doesn't explain. Also, the search / filter functionality is abysmal. Update: It's always crashing. You can't filter by custom price points. If it was some new start up it'd be mildly irritating but for Amazon...."
1,"1 star rating from me until Amazon learns to respect privacy. What's the point in asking me to set my preferences, if you're still going to show me items which I'm not interesting in viewing. Also, sorting items shouldn't reduce the number of items in your search results. If the initial number of items found is 2314, sorting it by lowest price or rating shouldn't make a difference, not should it include items that don't match the search parameters."
1,"2022 update means you can no longer rent or purchase music or films on the apps. You now have to go onto the website to do that. So not only do I need separate apps for each, I also need to go on to the website now too. It's ridiculous and frustrating. Amazon is already taking up so much of my phone, it's no longer feeling worth the hassle. Spotify, EBay and Netflix all combined are a lot less hassle than Amazon is becoming. The cons of Amazon are starting to outweigh the pros."
2,"Super slow since yesterday's update (11/11/22). Takes an age to load images and results. Usually a great app although the locations of some of the menus are counterintuitive. Will happily increase the rating once the app speed improves, at the moment it's like waiting for a dial-up modem to load each page."
2,"I live in Australia and have the app set as such. FREQUENTLY when I click on a link in discord, YouTube, websites etc etc it's to the US store. Rather than just show me the item... The app prompts me to change country. Every. Single. Time. I shouldn't need to change the country in the app just to view an item in another country, by all means flag it on the screen or in the items page or something... But don't force me to change the country for the whole damned app!"
2,Your last update broke the order page sorting. It used to show everything pending shipment before everything that was delivered. Your orders that were arriving this day would sit at the top. Now it's all a hot mess. You can't even view all of the preorder items. You have to search for them. It all worked great until today. Ridiculous. This happens every year. You get it working and then break it.
1,"As far as I'm concerned Amazon has went extremely downhill in recent years. I have many complaints with them. First, Amazon Prime. The only reason I use Amazon Prime is for 2 day shipping. They never fulfill it. Ever. They're not that great in prices. Best Buy and many other stores meet their prices pretty competitively anymore. But mainly Prime. Prime is a joke. If all you want is 2 day shipping. Prime is a succubus that doesn't give you anything in return."
2,"This app use to be fine no problems with it, then around 3 months ago I feel something has changed. It's terrible now. When you try to check your orders to be able to track delivery updates the app just sticks & says ""oops there seems to be a error"". I'm sick of this. Also Amazon use to give you updates on your deliveries but that feature seems to be a hit or miss now. Sometimes you don't know when the estimated delivery time is to track your order. Amazon please fix this!! Not acceptable!!"
1,"This app has been a part of my daily life for maybe a decade. Lately I've had increasing trouble getting decent search results with it. I mean, ridiculous, like when I shop for a power tool, I get bathing suits. Filters, options, and history are totally limited vs. the web site. The one time I asked for help with an app feature (today), I was told that THERE IS NO APP SUPPORT. For all the money I spend here, you can't lift a finger, but you keep trying to shove Alexa down my throat. Nope."
1,Useless Bot customer service. Amazon didn't deliver my parcel due to an issue on their end. I was notified I will be refunded but didn't get a refund. The Bot service takes me around on circles to track the item and to check refund status. It has been well over two weeks but it ends up with a message to wait two weeks for the refund. Amazon app is now as useless as Aliexpress for customer services
2,"What a mess Amazon has become over the last two years. 2 day shipping, if you're outside a metro area...? Nope. App freezing and crashing...almost constant. Ability to contact sellers...? If you're lucky. Pricing? Only the most strangely remote products are a bargain now...if it's a common item, I can always get it cheaper at Walmart, so sad. And what, 119/yr now? Seriously rethinking this nonsense..."
2,"1 Step For ward, 2 Steps Back in my opinion. Previous version of the app worked absolutely fine, the one thing it was missing was the ability to filter results by price. That's now been added in, but now the user interface is just an absolute minefield. Used to get you straight to the info you wanted in 1 click, now it's going to a page, scrolling, going into a sub menu etc. Notifications also now don't work - previously I'd get continuous tracking updates, now it rarely even tells me anything."
1,"Poor UI on Android App lags horribly and frequently freezes. Even after closing and doing a ""force stop"" on the app to refresh. Update: in less than 10 minutes, the app has shut down 4 times. Absolutely ridiculous. I was making a list and moving items from a different list."
2,"I love when they randomly remove the useful bits. Apparently they don't want to include age rating information for books anymore or Q&A for products or the ability to search reviews for details that aren't listed but are important to know before purchasing. It gets 2* because it's stable, but I swaer Amazon is continuously lowering the online shopping bar industry wide by showing companies just how bad you can be and still sell products."
3,It's no wonder Amazon has lost a trillion in market value. The gap between price versus value has only gotten bigger. Prime 2 day shipping has become 3-11 day shipping from the day it ships. The warehouse packers don't use common sense when packing items for shipment. I have already canceled my music unlimited subscription will be considering canceling Prime also.
1,Very dissapointed that the option to sort by lowest price first has been removed. This is a game changer. I used to shop using this all the time. Now I will have check out other options to buy things. Thankfully eBay still has this option. Looks like time to buy more via them instead. I'm glad to see that the Amazon browser still allows 'low to high' sorting of prices.
1,"Very annoying that you can't purchase through the app anymore, tried to buy an ebook via the kindle app, can't. Tried to buy it through amazon app, can't. Added it to my wishlist so I could find it on the website... none of my lists were there. Really tried to buy it but gave up and got it from a second hand book store... that's what I'll be doing from now on, feels better. Actually going to buy everything in person from now on, saves money and I only buy things I really need... goodbye Amazon!"
1,"Editing Wishlists is painful, editing anyone then entire list resets to default sorting and takes me back to the top of list. Lame App UI layout lead to not being able to even checkout for during a Lightning Deal, you have to scroll through a garbage wall of text for ""Amazon Products"" like TVs, with that ""Link device to your Amazon account..."" too much of a text wall blocked me from even finding where Amazon moved the checkout button!"
1,"I decided to stop using this App because I am unable to move it to my external storage permanently. The problem is that too many apps do the same and crowd by phone. Therefore every app that continue to stay in my internal storage I started to stop using. While you developers may not care as I am just one person, hopefully many others will soon follow my lead. Why not just allow the app to be stored in the phone's SD card?"
3,It's alright. I just wish before you bought used products it would show you what they look like. There have been times where I bought something like new and it was in horrible condition. Another problem I have is the search history glitching. Sometimes it only shows me two things in my search and sometimes five.
1,"These sports notifications are out of control. I don't follow or care about sports and no amount of advertising is going to make me watch it. The permissions for notifications on this app need modified by the dev to have separate notification channels for ads like sports or notifications for deliveries which I do care about, right now they are just under one option to turn them all on or off."
1,"Latest update on this app somehow does not include the ability to purchase digital content. Users must now have access to a PC if they want to buy streaming content (video and music) and digital books. Amazon has always been an unethical cash grab, but they can't get the right now."
1,Suddenly having an issue where every day my app switches to Spanish by itself. Fixed it three times but it kept happning again within the next 24 hours. Thought maybe I was hacked and changed my password and logged out of all devices and still the next two days in a row it's done it again. I don't know if this is a glitch but it's getting real old.
1,"Apps always been amazing & my go to every day. But the past few months its awful. Everytime you go to the search bar it glitches & takes a few seconds to load, then it doesn't come up with any suggestions you have to type the entire thing out & it then takes forever to load any listings! Even if you click on the different departments it takes forever to get there. I thought maybe I needed to update or something but no. It's put me off using it completely."
1,"They're so consistently bad at not doing their only job. I ordered a book and the first time that it was ""delivered"", it was taken to the completely wrong house. When I found the driver who apparently delivered it, he said he didn't remember where he took it (despite sending a confirmation photo). I spent the better part of an hour personally scouring the neighborhood searching for my package and still couldn't find it. After getting a refund and re-ordering the book, it came as a wrong cover"
1,"After Android 13 Amazon, Google, Google News, Gmail, Outlook, and Teams (thus far) no longer open and freeze even after a clear of cache, update, restart, and all. It even says to update after a bug is released from the Developer. There are no fixes available on the trouble shoot page or forums."
2,"Amazon is ok to use, but it shouldn't take 24hrs to verify your card information. If you place an order, the card should be immediately charged. Also the option for rush and overnight shipping should be added as an option to choose at the buyers discretion. This is the only app that I have had problems with lately."
1,"I barely have trouble loading, or searching, only would be better if filtering was better and accurate. It'll show other products too rather then more of what I would filter on or search for certain products. I rather shop at amazon then many other stores, you can save from several cents to several dollars from amazon. Customer service and policy is bad with amazon."
1,I was trying to track a Amazon package that is supposed to be on its way. But I was instructed the upgrade was necessary so I tapped the upgrade tab and I still can't get tracking information. And judging from the reviews the app upgrade is pretty much worthless. If I can't track my orders I might have to say goodbye to amazon.
1,Since the update it keeps glitching and jumping pages at a time while I'm looking at products. It also shows the same thing over and over page after page. Getting frustrated with the app.
3,"I think the spp used to be good..l Now everything i search is so irrelevant to what I'm actually searching.The filters don't help. I see the same irrelevant items over and over.Amazon used to be a cheaper option to buy from, but now its more expensive to buy from Amazon.When they have deals make sure you pay attention chances are it's not a deal and you can get it cheaper elsewhere.Like claiming something is 80% off at 99$ .Fantastic deal until you search that same product and it's $120 origina."
1,"The app is really bad lately, the order history keep disappearing and I have to reinstall the app to see it, everytime when you open the app you see adverts, first it was about the lord of the rings, now is prime access to sale or something, very irritating. There is no legal information if you click it it says: we can't find the page. Overall very bad experience lately."
2,"I gave two stars because every freaking month, Amazon boots me out of the app and denies my password. Once or twice a month I have to keep resetting it and its getting old. Not only that, any time any issue arises, Amazon redirects you away from the support numbers or makes it impossible to speak to someone."
1,"Sent me a fake tracking number and screwed me over on nearly 200 dollars. Their customer service is outsourced. And even though I made Amazon aware of a seller who's advertising products they don't have, Amazon continues to list it as in stock. I even spoke to a supervisor by Amazon US about it. And they couldn't care less. I rather order something directly from the seller or pay a little bit extra knowing that they don't purposely manipulate their stock. Stay away from Amazon!"
2,"Amazon completely broke my phone's voice recognition while using this app. Alexa has hijacked any attempt at voice recognition while in the app, which means I have to type everything out now. If I use Alexa, it thinks I'm trying to do some stupid search for whatever I'm trying to type, which makes it functionally useless. Thanks, Amazon for screwing us over like that."
1,For the last month and half everytime I try to get on my Amazon app it keeps messing up by telling me that something went wrong with it to close it of send a message and just about every other day or three days it will want to be updated and after the update I try to go on it and it keeps messing up or shutting it self off or when I am checking on my orders it shakes the screen and then turns itself off again and I try to go back on the Amazon app and does the same thing over and over again over
1,"Why am I getting notifications promoting NFL games from a shopping app? And with the way you're using the notification API, there's no way to disable NFL notifications without also disabling delivery notifications. Send those notifications to people who have prime video installed. Same with the full screen ads for LOTR y'all were running a few weeks ago."
1,"The continues refreshing of the main page is super annoying, also when I go back from a product page it's refreshing again everything and have to start scrolling from the beginning. The app is really slow, pictures loading extremely slowly on the product page, I can't zoom or open them until the page loaded completely, also can't like the product as the heart button has a latency. Subscription notification before renewal doesn't work at all, Amazon deducted the raised price that I didn't know!!!"
1,Constantly having loading issues. The removal of making music purchases from the Amazon music app AND Amazon app are poor practices attempting to push the subscription models of the business. When shopping for other items I tend to get redirected results pushing Amazon choice products rather than the brand I was looking for.
1,"I was searching for something today, and your stupid app started doing the most irritating thing in the world. It now thinks I want to see a stupid slide show for EVERY PRODUCT IN THE SEARCH RESULTS!! It's so jarring and annoying when I'm scrolling and every dang result shows a flipping video. Stop it, or give me the option to stop it. I. HATE. This."
1,"I only gave a 1 star bc I have to, they were charging me twice for prime come to find out there were 2 accounts on same email. I asked to cancel the old one I don't use they said ok we got it, they canceled the wrong one! So I've been in contact for 2 days now and now all of a sudden they can't find the account I use. Even gave an order number from something I JUST ordered and they can't seem to find anything. I've been hung up on, and given the run around! This is ridiculous! So much money gon"
1,"Wish the app had option for dark mode. It's white interface is too harsh on my eyes. Update: Service has been trash every since Amazon started using their shuttles to deliver themselves I've only experienced extremely late or undelivered packages. It's funny how things work, years ago I so ordering from Walmart online out of convenience as of now Walmart+ has given me way less of a headache."
4,"I'm a list person. I make lists and buy from them over time by need. This app has made it so difficult to use lists. I can't delete empty/old lists, I can't move things between lists- not to mention the lagging, filter issues, and random freezing. Ugh."
1,"Deliveries are now chronically late with no recourse. They are still promising delivery dates that they know cannot be kept and charging more for prime. This 800 lb. gorilla is out of control. The faults are many. ""Your package is close"" See it on the map"" Your package has been delivered"" notifications all come in the following day. Side by side comparisons are clumsy and the UI has changed for no reason or improvement that I can see. Better off opening in your browser."
1,"How to piss off consumers 101 by Amazon - remove digital content purchasing in apps. What is the point of having this app if you can't purchase content? Seriously considering canceling all Amazon subscriptions until this is fixed. Can't buy books through Kindle app, can't buy audiobooks through Audible. Told to go to website to buy the item. Website sends you back to the app."
3,"Problems with subscribe and save. You can choose a backup product. The customer wants the SAME item as a substitute from another seller. But noo AMAZON isn't NORMAL and they SUGGEST 6-7 UNRELATED items that are NASTY suggestions for substitutes and you can't add the substitute you want which is a larger or smaller amount of the SAME item from the same or a different seller. I subscribed to 12 Spaghettios w/ meatballs and want 24 pack of Spaghettios w/meatballs as a backup, but not Amazon."
4,"11-3-22- I have 107 S&S items. It is impossible to change the pmt method. I keep a gift card recharged so it won't ping my bank acct on small items. Once I subscribe, that setting cannot be changed in this app!.. Use this app (just about) every day. Great app. Easy to search and find great things you just 'gotta have'."
1,"Shocking that you are now forced to have the Alexa button in the bottom left of the app, despite removing microphone permissions, installing & reinstalling the app. No way to disable it so it's not there. Rubbish being forced to have something in the app I didn't ask for. It appeared after accidentally tapping the microphone button, now it won't go away."
1,"A couple of times I've thought of something I need, so opened up Amazon to have a look and order something, the app has lagged and I've forgotten what I was looking for. Closed down th app, lost yourself a sale on more than one occasion. No notifications when my items are on there way either now."
1,So. Tired of lagging and slow response to trying to add to lists. Its as if the app is more for looking and purchasing. I can add to cart and purchase in seconds but try to add item to a list almost impossible. I often add to cart then save for later until i can add to list. Why cant they fix it. They got the funds
1,"Will not be renewing Prime delivery is always late now. The price increase comes with updates that are reduced in product functionality. Not worth it. The inability for Amazon to restrict a toddler from upgrading an account is ridiculous. My account settings are set with passwords and restricted as much as possible on my end and yet I'm still sitting on the phone with customer service for an hour or more, trying to correct Amazon's mistakes. Fix this issue!"
3,"Not to sure about bulk prices on items. I find better deals at other warehouse outlets. Not all items are fairly priced. Price per oz, or price per sqaure yard, just finding a better value elswhere. However, there are very few products i will buy from here now. Thinking of getting rid of subscribe and save options."
1,"The only reason I downloaded this app was because the website was trying to use it for authentication. The site says in order to log into my Amazon account, I need to accept the notification in Amazon shopping. So I downloaded the app, logged into the same Amazon account, tried to send the notification from the website again, and it never came up. As far as I'm concerned this app has only one purpose, and it fails at it."
1,"I need help with this app. For weeks I am getting an error "" Uh-oh something went wrong on our end."" I even uninstalled and reinstalled. Rebooted my phone. But I can not use the app on my Samsung galaxy note 9 phone anymore. No one can get on Amazon app connected to Comcast internet at my house."
2,"It will never load to my phone, yet each time I have to open it thru the Play Store it's always 'OPEN'. It's a frigging pain especially when all of their other brand related apps download properly & don't change. It's stopped me from ordering as much bc of the time wasting, frustration and constant password issues this has caused."
5,"I love shopping through Amazon, it's a little too fun. App is great, keeping track and placing orders is always easy. Wish I could control ad content. There are certain things I don't care at all to see."
3,"Strong suggestion for the developer. An awesome update I would suggest..... make it so you can either ""move"" or ""delete"" multiple items from a list at one time. So if there is a lot of things you need to move to another list or delete you can do it MUCH easier than having to go through one by one. The lists glitch for me quite a bit too. Where things won't move or delete or it won't let me scroll through the list."
3,"I would normally give this app more stars, but I HATE that you can no longer purchase books in the app. This seems absolutely absurd that you can purchase everything except books. This is very inconvenient and annoying! Fix whatever agreement you have with the Play store. I am very disappointed."
1,"I hate how icons for items are now videos... I'm scrolling, trying to look for a product I want, and I can't even tell what products look like because it's a teeny tiny video of people moving around. The whole experience is distracting and unpleasant."
1,"Update: I'm so done with Amazon. I spend so much money and it's ripped me off for the last time. Christmas is coming from somewhere else. Now I have advertisements when I open the app - in a ""prime member "" and now I have stupid pop up adds! Bogus. Amazon, your sinking yourself Fed Ex is used to arrive but UPS to ship returns - so very inconvenient. Old version is forever on my phone. Charges to purchase series even tho I am a prime member... Lots of room to improve."
1,"Use to be 5 stars, but now I can't return anything. I have 3 defective items I got from Amazon, fairly expensive stuff, and they won't let me return it or give my money back anymore. Just takes you around in circles no matter where you go, demands you enter all the same info in each step, then ultimately says it can't be returned and you are basically out of luck. Even their ""customer service"" contacts were a waste of time. I guess Amazon decided all sales are final."
1,"Loved using Amazon for the majority of all my purchases but this past year this app has been horrible handling my prime purchases, I never get anything within the 2 days of my purchase anymore and when I check the status of my orders it never shows the correct order status, I don't know what happened this year but I'm beginning to think sometimes Ebay or store apps are better for getting my purchases on time :( I'm so close to quitting Amazon, having a Prime membership is worthless 😡"
2,"App and service are great. The drivers are a different story. Don't bother ordering something that is expensive or something someone else would want because it will usually end up being ""delivered"" but you won't be able to find the package. Ordered a really cool and pricey cyberpunk mask, waited over 3 weeks for it just to encounter a ""problem"" with delivery. Never showed but at least I got a refund. I would keep the prime membership of they'd hire honest drivers."
1,"Wow ! Amazon such as lied in my life. I tried Prime on Amazon it's very cool for shipping and prime deals. But this is my real review on Amazon. Order my stuff but when I return, they don't refund to you Debit cart. It came back with Gift card. Also I used my balance gift card to order another things. But they don't count my refund to ordered another things. I mean my refund is gone as I returned items. Then charged me prime every month when I click to stop then page error.Thanks Amzon"
1,Absolutely horrible lately!! I paid over 240.00 four times for one order and it still hasn't shipped!! Pay for prime shipping and absolutely nothing comes faster then 10 days!! Was expecting something for my sick kid tomorrow now it's another 10 days away!! Amazon has become a complete joke and will lose a lot of customers!! Once my items arrive and my money is refunded I'm cancelling my Amazon account and never looking back!!
2,"Even after updates still issues, example - drop lists that do not work ""do anything"" and you cannot filter your searches which is a BIG failure ""greedy sales push"" for alternatives. Ask user to select (for more options) would be less offensive."
5,"Oh My Gosh! I am so pleased with this app. I have used this app many times before and the shipping was very reliable. However, I order something yesterday and did standard shipping. It wasn't supposed to arrive for about 5 days but it arrived today. So it came literally the next day! Good job amazon. Just another reason why I pretty much live on amazon."
1,"As for last few updates using app is getting more and more unbearable. I have shared Prime as household member. First I was regularly harrased with ""get amazon prime"" screen every second time I tried to check something quickly. Now I can't even filter stuff by prime. None of these issues obviously exists on website so there is only one conclusion - it's done on purpose. I guess no more spending money on a whim for me till it's fixed 🤷‍♀️"
3,"The deliveries for my area are ALWAYS late. The app is ok mostly, but there really needs to be some way to report issues with delivery times. I don't want to talk to some local delivery guy who will do nothing. I want Amazon to auto refund the delivery cost when not delivered on time (so the delivery companyloses money everytime they fail to meet standards)."
1,"Terrible marketplace. They ask for an OTP. I put the OTP. They block me. Now I have to call an Italian number. I don't have an Italian number to call it even though I'm Italian. Amazon does NOT respect the rules of the EU. I can live in a different country as I like, then you need to give me the possibility of accessing my account anyway. Not depriving me of it out of ""safety"". Terrible customer experience, now I have to go through the usual passive-agressiveness of customer service and all."
1,I love using amazon but yall got some things to figure out. When you search for things you usually end up with 100 random things that have nothing to do with what you searched and the filters are absolutly usless. The app its self does not work you guys keep updating the app and it just gets worse everytime and just the other day a $250 pair of shose that i never even searched or liked for that matter was trying to be purchased from my account.
3,"Please allow users to disable video thumbnails, or just eliminate them altogether. I can't believe anybody thought that was a helpful feature, but it makes browsing more difficult."
1,"Terrible shopping experience. I used to enjoy shopping on amazon until I figured out there is no customer support contact and they only have a support page as I have been dealing with problems with my orders being shipped. I've been trying to contact Amazon to switch over shipping services from intelcom as they refuse to deliver packages since August 25th, and the guarantee arrival date we get from amazon is always void as we wont get our packages for over a month past the delivery date."
1,"Very upset at Amazon. I have been having to return damaged products, wrong sizes, missing items in my orders. I don't know who to complain to since it keeps happening and calling complaining to customer service has only seemed to make the problem worse. It seems like since I have complained the bad service has gotten accelerated. Almost like it's my fault for getting bad service. It has driven me to tears that at every order there has to be a problem and they don't care to make it any better."
3,"I shop on Amazon quite a bit. Never really had a bad experience, just don't like how when an order qualifies for free shipping, Amazon automatically selects paid shipping and I have to go change it to free."
1,"What's happening to the search bar in the app, I type my desired product I'm searching for and I can't even see what I've typed, it just white? So I've typed my product I want and the bar goes across but no writing at all. Sort it out app designers as there should be no reason for this to happen. After going through the reviews I've noticed a lot of low star reviews on the app and it's updates, why is this happening? Why try to fix something that wasn't broken?"
1,Amazon used to be a great app and a great way to shop. You used to be able to search for a specific item and find it but not anymore. Now the search and filters are useless and laughable. Whoever they're paying to make this app is trying their best to destroy Amazon from within. Too bad no one is at the helm paying attention. No one even bothers to read these Google play reviews.
1,"Customer service is garbage. I keep talking to people overseas, who barely speak English, then get hung up on by supervisors - or they just refuse to return calls. They are trying to charge me for an item I've already returned. I have the UPS tracking label, but they're still trying to charge me. Reporting them to the State Attorney General and BBB, for fraud, if they continue to try to charge me"
1,What is going on with the app Amazon? I've never had any issues until the last few weeks. There have been so many issues from trying to search to adding an item to cart. I order weekly but if this keeps up I'm going to have to shop elsewhere bcuz it is that bad.
1,"Can't buy ebooks from the app anymore! This issue is a real problem that needs to be fixed ASAP! Here it is November, and problem still not fixed. So frustrating that this hasn't been corrected. Lowered my rating to ONE STAR."
1,"Since the update from 11/11/22, everything is in Spanish. I went to the web page and not the app and made sure it said ""English,"" however, that still didn't fix the app. There are no buttons showing to use English in the app."
1,"Amazon isn't worth using as a service anymore. It is past its prime (no pun intended). There are more restrictions on returns, and the convenience of 2 day shipping is extinct. 2 day shipping was never free it was wrapped into the sellers prices, but it came in 2 days. Items are no longer cheaper to purchase online and can be cheaper in brick and mortar stores. There's no justification for continuing to use amazon as a service when it does more harm than good and eliminates convenience."
1,"Not so much about the app as delivery. My first order from Amazon, I am 16 and just started working this year so decided to get mom something nice for Christmas. Item costed $200. Had it shipped to dad's office so she wouldn't find out, with specific instructions about where to deliver since this is a bad part of town. I did not want it at the front door, and I said if no one was around, don't deliver. They delivered it at the front door, in a place covered with graffiti.🤦‍♀️😡"
1,Stop showing me a lower price. Then when I click on the item. It's higher. And one of the other options is the price that was shown before I clicked on it. That's why I don't shop ebay. And I could quickly quit Amazon too. It's a scam
2,Amazon is okay to use but... just had a really bad experience won't be using their services anymore. Got a product from one of their sellers that was a bait and switch I left a review that was not offensive that explained the issue in detail and it was removed so this person can continue to rip people off.. this will be going on more frequently due to the negligence for the sake of money. Quality and service is something unheard of these days.
3,"Post update use is ok, just slow. Relevant push updates are either sporadic or none existent. I HATE the way the App clears/resets previous searches/activity & defaults back to the home screen if I go off app & come back; I then have to start again! The current app is definitely less responsive & slower than the pre-face change update! Note: I have re-edit my original review I wrote immediately after the app facelift because a few elements have been resolved & improved. The review above stands."
2,"So far the app is unresponsive to the command to search for cat toys. I've given the 2 stars because setup of the account was easy. I hope to have the issue with the app quickly resolved, and have a satisfactory shopping experience for years to come. I'd like to give you 5 stars."
1,Not a bad app but everytime someone sends me a link it switches to their language and I have to go to the the settings and change it back. It is quite annoying. The app is now sending adds in the notifications= one star
2,Had one of my ordered damaged by Amazon. They advised me they would give me a credit to reorder it as I bought the item originally on sale. Couldn't use the credit as it was not an item sold by Amazon. Then I was made to pay full price to reorder the item they originally damaged. Supervisor Omar didn't help solve the problem and was useless for a supervisor. Not happy at all with Amazon.
2,I thought I would use this app to simplify things. It has a different layout than the regular website and takes a bit of adjustment. The biggest problem is that it frequently freezes. Annoying.
4,"Edit: Great place to find what you need or want... But now, (other than the new ""Click on the Icon"" updated option) it is difficult to find your ""Subscribe and Save"" pending orders once your in the app. It used to be a button for it after you clicked your Home button. Now you have to hunt for it. And I mean, HUNT!"
1,Before I was happy with the app but now I'm very disappointed because I ordered one device and then it says that It will be delivered today at 8:00pm an was out for delivery but suddenly it says that customer stopped for pickup and I didn't do that and when I contacted them about it they said that USPS will contact you within 1 to 2 days and then it will deliver to you this is the last time I use Amazon. I will uninstall the app because today's experience bad app
5,"The Best Store pay from, But the App is poor in use after updates ... It is difficult to navigate from accounts between countries and search for your previous purchases .... The developers are kindly requested to reformulate the program in an easy way and shorten the repetition between menus"
1,So I ordered some things and I chose the shipping option for the smallest amount of packages. So it says I have 2 deliveries. Great! 👍 Then a few days later I find out you broke them up into three deliveries! What is wrong with you people?! Why do you keep doing this?!! Update 11-3 2020. Same thing just happened again. Ordered 5 things that were supposed to be in 2 shipments. Then you shipped them in 5 individual packages!! Why?!! They're all going to the same place so why do that?!!
3,It's annoying when the language keeps changing in the app. I read somewhere if you possibly clicked on a site in another language it could cause the language to change. Don't know if true but I have not done this and it always switches to Spanish. I have my language preference set to English. Language should not change when you have chosen your preference.
2,"I've been receiving the ""uh oh"" error message constantly when navigating the app for weeks. It has progressively increased in frequency to the point that the app is basically unusable now."
1,"When ever I search for clothes it is showing results dark not able to see image of items clearly, after clicking on item it is showing properly. It's frustrating I am not able to choose items only after clicking on I am able to see it's color etc I tried clearing cache data also uninstalled and reinstalled no use"
1,"This is more about Amazon than the app. Their grocery delivery is unreliable and horrible. Don't waste your money. Over half the new books I've bought in the past 6 months have been damaged. Cleaning supplies are significantly more expensive than in stores, even local owned places with generally inflated prices. Amazon isn't worth it anymore with so many other options for free 2 day delivery."
1,The new update is making it so I can not add things to my cart via android Samsung phone. I have been trying to order a phone case through Amazon prime and I have picked 5 different brands and none of them will let me add the cases to my cart. I'm getting livid and overly frustrated.
2,I have lost faith in this company! Often items arrive after the estimated arrival date. My last order was shipped the day it was supposed to arrive! Wal Mart will now be the first app I search! The items I ordered from there (same day I ordered Amazon items) arrived in 2 days. It has been several years since Amazon has lived up to their 2 day promise (even vefore Covid).
3,The ads get in the way. And when I search something for kids it gives me something for adults. And for prime it doesn't really work because like it just gives the same stuff without prime. And about the lists it's just okay they could be better. And you can also make the search bar better.
1,"This so-called ""new and improved"" app is total trash. Video reviews rarely play, the app is incredibly slow to load, shipments are always running late and the search function is a joke. Amazon wants everyone's business but they clearly can't handle the volume. They've really gone downhill over the last couple years, especially this app 👎"
1,"Amazon has really gone downhill this past year. Packages that would take two days to deliver, now take over a week to arrive if they show up at all. They must be moving everything to China or something it shouldn't take a week to put a package on a truck my order has been sitting at warehouse over a week. I think my business will be switching to ebay to get business done faster. Customer service at Amazon does not care at all about the customers and just lies to them to go away."
1,"I recently did the new update and now I can't check my orders 90% of the time. I am an avid Amazon user, I check on my orders on a daily basis. If I can't see when my packages are due, there is no use for this app. I press on the order button and the page just keeps reloading. PLEASE FIX THIS NOW. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared my cache, and have powered down and powered on my phone multiple times. Nothing is working. I have a Samsung Ultra 22. Please get on it. Thanks."
1,Worst app and customer service ever. First of all the deliveries are late and if you have to return the product. You have to pay for the postage costs . I bought a jacket of 50 $ and it doesn't fit . So i decided to return it. But when i went yo canada post they said i have to lay 40$ to send this parcel. I mean paying 40$ to get a refund of 50$ . It isn't Worth it for sure. And the product quality is not good as well. I will never ever go for this app . Instead Shein is better .
1,"Constant letdowns by Amazon as a whole. PAY for ""priority delivery"" & despite my address not changing since I created my account, there's frequent ""delivery address issues"" causing delay, often arriving LATER than with free delivery! The recent app updates are horrendous, there's the main icon, the basket icon and that's all, I can't even access an order I'm currently waiting for! All in all, a complete shambles of a company with zero regard for their customers!!"
1,"Unwelcome, forced adds for irrelevant trash being displayed before allowing me to access the app. If this keeps up, the store isn't such a bad option anymore. I rarely find the best deals on Amazon, only the most convenient. Amazon is incapable of keeping up with its deliveries and regularly fails to deliver when promised. When items are finally delivered, they are left I'm plain view of the street insteadof the large secure box on my porch. Amazon likes to encourage package theft."
1,"Amazon the tech Giant. Worth 900+ Billion dollars. Capitaling in the convenience of shopping on your phone, and impulse buying on your phone even at night, in bed, when you should be asleep. Not writing reviews for their App. But that's just it see. If only Amazon had this level of self awareness and could recognize the value in having a dark mode setting."
1,"Error message when trying to purchase. I've used this site numerous times. And now for some reason when I'm trying to make the purchase it's not working. I've added other cards, so have tried 5 different cards - all of which are not working. I've logged out and back in. And uninstalled, then reinstalled the app as well. Quite frustrating 😒"
2,"Search + filters is awful especially if you sort by price low to high. You'll get several unrelated items to the point of ad nauseum, which is likely a feature not a bug so you buy ""featured items"" instead. Wish list management is a NIGHTMARE. You can only move so many items before the app becomes un-usable and just freezes up."
1,Tried to open the Amazon Shopping app and keep getting shown a video promoting Rings of Power. Can't skip or stop if from playing each time I open the app. I came to Amazon Shopping to buy something not watch a show. Trying to ram this show down my throat has 1. Stopped me from doing the thing I went to the app to do 2. Put me off from watching the show. I went somewhere else and bought the item I was after. If obtrusive promotions continue within the app I'm likely to delete it.
1,"Come on Amazon!!! Automatic videos for everything while scrolling through???? People hated that with Netflix, why would this ever be a good idea??? I just want to look at the item and not have to chose whether to watch a video or not. Just leave things be. Stupid idea."
2,"Can be a good deal or your stuff may never arrive Over the last 6 months I purchased a record that never came so they auto canceled it while the price doubled. A flash drive that never came and now a bike pump that is over a week late. Due to customer service failures and the lack of a human to work with the application just points you to another unhelpful link. Makes me wonder if I would be better off just going to a store as I planned ahead but it is still ""out for delivery"""
2,"This Amazon ap is really slow and hard to use since this last update. You push the button that says ""add to cart"" and then get a message that the item you want was not added to your cart. And then when the ap refreshes you will have 2 or 3 of the same item in your cart. That is, if you don't get a message saying ""go to Amazon home, something went wrong."" I am seriously considering closing my Amazon account due to the difficulty with the use of the ap on your phone or the computer."
1,"They've recently begun sending advertising via notifications from the app and if you want to stop them you have to turn off all notifications, even important ones, as they don't use Android's fine tuned notifications controls."
1,the new app is messed up. a friend sent me a link to look at something and the text was in Spanish and now the app is showing me everything in Spanish. I even changed the language to English but it hasn't changed. the small print has give it 48 hrs but it's been since 3 days.
4,"Great offer free delivery trial. I don't have enough experience with ordering to use app. Or others. Walmarts is difficult too. But my vehicle has been not drivable for 4 months now. These free delivery trials are very good, handy, a life saver. Thank you by the way...if made it more simple, more efficient trying to simply type what need and it do what asked for.. I tried to reach customer service 50 x's different pre suggested ways and found it some how. Needs redesigned from ""broad look"" """
1,"Poor customer service. I've been locked out of my account due to a minor error on my part- there is a balance I need to pay. I tried paying several times, there's a problem on the back end that apparently nobody can fix. Account specialist was supposed to email me within 2 business days... it's been weeks and no word. I'll be seeking a refund on my prime payment."
1,App is not loading correct # of items in the cart. I have 2 in amzon and it says 3. I go to amazon fresh it says theres nothing it the cart but shows 1 on the cart symbol. So odd. I cant get it to correct itself. Wish it was easier to report bugs and get help. On facebook you just shake your phone and it brings up a way to submit an issue. That kind of function would be very helpful.
2,"I upgraded to a fold 4 and the orders page is not good. On my Galaxy s22 ultra the orders page shows the next item being shipped on top all the time. The orders page for the note 4 is listed by date so if something takes 2 weeks to arrive I have to scroll through all my other orders that arrived in 1 or 2 days to find it. This makes the experience very tedious and I prefer not to feel this way when tracking an order. Please add a ""delivered"" filter, or duplicate the s22 orders page on the fold 4"
2,"Whatever happened with the most recent update, please go back or fix it! It crashes all the time, it's difficult to search for certain items, and it won't let me change certain settings (like currency, language, etc.) It's so annoying to use it now! 🙄"
4,"Why did they hide the Orders list way down under Your Stuff? Sure, that seems logical, but I have to go hunting for it every time now, and it used to be in the menu where I could access it readily to see when my orders are expected to arrive. Sometimes useful isn't logical."
4,"Still prefer browser based Amazon website. I'm one of those... Apps steel your liberty through EULA and control your user experience. There are areas on an items page I want to zoom in on and the app prevents this. Also, I find better deals through my browser search & can't seem to find the exact same items offered in the app without directly searching by ASIN. Yet on the positive side it's the only retailers app I keep on my Android.... So there's something decent in the experience."
1,"Edit: dropped to 1 star cause I was looking for heaters and half the reviews are for other products like cups, baby hammocks, etc.. How can I find a good product when the reviews arent for the item I'm looking at? Trying to search for a messenger bag and it refuses to just let me look in all departments. It keeps pulling it up in electronics. Stop forcing me to look into departments that I don't want. It's getting ridiculous how much amazon has changed and it's even worse on the computer."
4,"Generally I have no issues with the app and use it all the time. Recently the 'Save item' heart on individual items has either been moved or made more sensitive. When I'm scrolling down to see more details, price, etc. the app opens my 'choose a list to save item' pop up all the time. I am left handed and am scrolling on the left side of the screen, so this is probably only an annoyance for us lefties."
1,App keeps changing the language to Spanish. I change the preference back to English and it reverts right back to Spanish. I'm can't read Spanish so no purchases will be made. It's a good way to guarantee loss of revenue.
2,"This service is getting worse from day to day, 24hr turn round is turning into three days and sometimes never turning up at all. I believe that for 89€ we are not receiving the service they say they are advertising shame on you Amazon. I have cancelled my Prime account as I get better movies from Netflix and Spotify is alot better music service. Thanks for a service that's deteriorated over the years."
2,It's annoying to use now that it pops up an ad every time you open it that you can't skip for like 5 seconds for their stupid failing lord of the rings show. Plus while you're scrolling they try and make you watch the annoying product live streams by making them open if you swipe up... The thing you HAVE to do to navigate through the app. Two stars only because it does what is supposed to do
4,"I really like shopping Amazon and using the app. I am having problems with the loading number next pages, such as when I search for somthing or I'm trying to check out it just spins ans spins."
3,"The app is great! But I can't use it. Amazon drivers aren't given the tools they need to do their job, ie: a decent manifest that doesn't cut off delivery instructions. I live in complex w many bldgs. Drivers just get a list with the apt#s! (I talked with one.) With over 40bldgs and 550 apts, impossible 2 make sense unless directions are provided. If only the drivers had a way to read what I wrote they'd have no trouble, my pkgs would get here. As it is they just mark the pkgs delivered. SMDH"
5,"Bad foreign customer service. They avoid any issue with a large list of loops to avoid any sort of exchange or credit. Generic call script copy pasta. Bad bad bad Horrible company sent debt collection no notice and multiple charge attempt on my old bank, many return echeck fees and extra charges with their collection agency they forward."
1,"Almost Useless. This app is next to useless. I can't get it to load the list of departments and it won't search for what I want without very specific wording - and I'm not sure what wording to use! When the app starts up, it shows a front screen. There are some icons at the bottom, which presumably should show my account details and allow access to departments, but the screen just goes white and nothing happens. Hopeless. I may as well delete this app."
1,"They don't even show you shipping costs anymore until you check out. I ended up spending more on shipping than the actual thing I bought, and I had no idea. It's dangerous to buy things when I don't know the real full price I'm paying. I can't buy from here anymore. I found out that a family member paying for prime, which gives you free shipping anyway, is the only one being showed the shipping prices."
3,"There is a bug when I try to open my "" Your Orders"" sometimes loads and a lot of time is only trying to but only a progres bar at the top goes on and one and nothing happens. The rest is perfect 👍"
1,This isn't the first time having problems with this app deducting from my debit card almost $5. I have suffient amount of my EBT which I double checked before I buy. And yet I clear cache and take off my groceries and put them back again. Still trying to make me pay $4.50 with my debit card which again I pay EBT. For the past 2 hours trying to use my EBT I have no transportation to get food so I use Amazon. No help with updates.
1,They used to be great. Now they've outsourced almost all customer service calls. Used to be one could request a US representative. No more!! We're stuck with horrible English and sub-par service. It's no longer worth the price for Prime except maybe for Black Friday deals and usually other retailers are as good. Shame Amazon's delivery services and customer service is destroying them. RIP as I am done.
1,Awful I try to check out and it won't let me. The app is super slow and says Uh oh please try again something went wrong. Has been working fine until just now. Also super hard to find certain pages. I even tried logging in on the website and purchase some things and still wouldn't let me.
1,"It used to be great but now each time I open the app I'm hit with a full page video advert of their latest Prime series. That's no way to advertise successfully. It creates resentment toward the show, I'm no way gonna watch it. Even if I was interested in it I'd now avoid it just because I'm unhappy with their means of advertising it. I think I'll be using the browser version for a while until the next update. Hopefully they'll learn from this mistake."
3,If your looking for something specific it's hard to find. Some things I try to get rid of like old credit cards & old addresses are nearly impossible. But Amazon does have most everything.
2,"I shop on Amazon quite often and the customer service on here used to be absolutely stellar because they always used to resolve my issues promptly and their deliveries were always on time if not earlier than what they initially told me. However, since they teamed up with Intelcom I have received my first ever delayed parcel on a bday gift. 95% of the reviews for Intelcom were negative as well, very disappointed that amazon would continue to work with such an incompetent Courrier service."
1,"This app has gone downhill. The search function returns all kinds of trash that is only vaguely related to the search terms. Also, I've had multiple packages delayed several times over recently, so maybe Amazon as a whole is in decline. But hey, I'm sure all the corporate officers are swimming in money, so it's all good."
1,"I bought a television. An Amazon fire TV. Amazon doesn't do returns for 3rd party sellers. It came from Best Buy. They won't do exchanges or returns so I'm out of almost $300. Since they don't show which items are 3rd party sellers, I quit Amazon prime ... again. Both times are because of the customer support. The first time they tried to get money for re-stocking fees for something that came directly from the seller and refused to allow me and seller to communicate."
1,"You've made purchasing music so difficult that even tho I've used Amazon exclusively for mp3 purchases for at least 13 years, I am now looking for another service. I don't just want to stream music, I want to buy and download what I like. I can't purchase from the Amazon Music app anymore, and the Amazon Shopping app says ""Digital music is not available for purchase from this device."" Why?! Buying music should be easy."
3,Great when it works and frustrating when it's not. The app used my font and apparently that didn't work so well and I could only see half the text for an option or button.
1,"Used to be able to return my stuff via royal mail, but now they don't let you print a label out, you have to mess about in the shop for ages to return stuff, next day delivery a rarity too on a weekend, which kind of eliminates it's advantage over other places, so I don't really order much any more. Real shame. Back to eBay)Argos for me. :("
4,"Great app, I use it daily. I do, however, recommend that the app creators stop messing with the formatting. Every week I have to relearn how to use the damn thing, and somehow they've decided its smart to make your own orders the hardest to find! Anyways, why complain, they'll have changed it next week again lol"
1,"NEVER AGAIN, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I'm very disappointed with Amazon service as they took my payment for the order and put the order on hold after that due to their internal checks. So they're asking about my personal details, my cards, etc. All security checks should be done before payment, not after! And that's very weird to suspect a person just for a shopping. You should deliver goods and trust you consumers. If you dont want to serve me - just return my money and good bye!"
1,"Terrible, even went through the phone support and was told I did everything possible and it still did not work. Bluetooth pick up what could go wrong. How about a simple code we enter and door pops open. Ground breaking ideas from one infuriated customer that can't pick up their order and is now going to best buy."
3,"I use to love Amazon. Now they take your payment when each item or seperate order ships, For someone who lives paycheck to paycheck, it's hard to determine when all the money's taken out. It sucks, they use to take the payment out as soon as you order like they should. Now the money could sit in there for weeks, if I need something I forget they didn't take it all out yet, I look at my balance and buy what I need. Then my Amazon bounces and needs an updated payment and I'm screwed!!!"
2,I have lost a package and now another one of my packages is late. The date changed 4 times over the past 3 weeks. They tried to issue me a refund and stop shipment without asking me if that's what I wanted. All I asked was why the dates keep changing and if I am going to get it. They said it was because of the weather but it has been 3 weeks almost 4.
3,"In my 27 years of using computers and 15 years of using smartphones. I've never came across the issue of a program reverting to another country's storefront or in another language. My issue is not that there's forgian languages or storefronts. My issue is getting it back to the US storefront with English. Especially trying to navigate around in a language I don't know. It seems every time I fix the issue, the next day it switches to another country and or language."
1,"The new update I can't even select sizes for shirt, or look at different colours. It's been really really slow thus last year. I've updated the app, Uninstalled, and installed it again but nothing."
2,"I've been a prime member for years, and the service has become awful; since before covid, so that's not an excuse. Items constantly delivered to the wrong unit, because the drivers don't take time to look for our building. Items get marked delivered before they're actually delivered, I've brought this up SEVERAL times with the chat, but they give me the ""just wait 24 hours"" song and dance. What's the point of delivery notification if it's unreliable and Amazon doesn't care? We pay for this bs."
4,Why can't we rearrange our own wish lists in order of necessary or price. When i heart something it automatically adds it to my default list instead of giving me a choice to send it to one of my other saved lists. It seems it would be easier to organize like pinterests' setup.. I play alot of fb games where we gift each other It would save alot of time if we could just go in & long press & rearrange our list or put them in order of low to high or hide some we aren't ready to get yet.
1,"The app keeps changing my language preference without my permission. It keeps changing to Spanish and I only speak and read English. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it to get back to English. I HATE THIS ABOUT THIS APP. This should NEVER happen! Please Amazon, make this stop! Then I'll give the app a better rating."
1,"Amazon has too many vendors on it that are not held accountable. In the last several purchases, I have received a shelving unit that was missing all of the hardware. Still waiting on that to be resolved. The vendor said it could take up to 14 business days. I also have received items with poor packaging. The box looks like it was rolled down the hill before arriving on my doorstep. Many products have minor damaged. I've had multiple items that arrive late and not on the provided date."
1,"I use to think this app was 5 stars, but I'm not sure if it's even worth 1 star. The customer service is terrible all they want to do is lie to you instead of taking the time to fix the problem. I had made a order and still not sure but I got an email saying I needed to revise my payment method which I did but it never fixed it so I canceled the order. So I thought I found out that I didn't bcuz they tried charge me for it again! They really need to get it together and get some better ppl..."
2,The app constantly changes my language without any form of confirmation or query. I live in Germany and want the app in German SPECIFICALLY to make it easier to find products under their German names. It is infuriating to have to manually change it back to German on the regular.
1,"ALL OF MY LISTS ARE GONE!!! I went into the app today to review models and pricing of things I had saved in my lists, and all of my shopping and wish lists (total of 4, all had been accessed and added/deleted content within 60 days) are GONE! I had Christmas shopping lists, specific product pages on components, and Amazon deleted all my info. BRING THEM BACK"
1,"The package was marked as delivered in the app, but nobody showed up or called. The only option I am given is a refund, but since it was a product with a discount I have to pay more than initially if I were to order again. Looks like Amazon is just baiting me into buying a product at a higher price than initially offered."
5,"I love Amazon the only real complaint I have is with their filters. They have such a huge selection of anything imaginable, and sometimes i just need to buy something very specific and I know exactly what features i want and dont want but the filters do not let me narrow down my search as it should. Amazon please make your filters user friendly and allow us to narrow down our search. There is so many times that i end up not ordering anything because i could not find exactly the item i needed it."
4,Simply good ...edit 9.2.22 I love the app but my only gripe is that I would rather use the browser version because I can put in an exact price point that I don't want to go over for specific items. If it's in the app I cannot find it. Not putting in the search bar an item under a certain amount.
3,"I love using Amazon. However, when i log in It keeps turning into Spanish not English. Then my stuff got hacked. Almost lost 5000 dollars. Can you please check your end as I have tried everything. Let me know if I have been hacked in any way please. Oh yeah also how do you delete a card that is no longer available.? These things are not easy for me to figure it out."
1,"Sockingly bad delivery service! 5 of my last orders arent arrived to my address. Each time they said delivered to me on the app! I was able to lacate my packages on the nerby streets at same house numbers! Their drivers are absolutely useless. I dont mind if they leave it next door but dont say they left it with me when they didn't! I wish they would left the packages next door but they just leave it at random houses in the area, and its keep happening! I will stop using amazon for shopping now."
3,"Been using the app for years. Mostly fine. Noticed a recent bug today in the wishlist section. You can see comments you've added to items in list view. But if you try and edit a comment, the original comment is not shown while editing. E.g. it treats it like an add not edit. If you save, obviously the original comment is lost. This used to work properly, so is a regression issue. There should be a way in the app to report bugs, I couldn't find any, so here I am."
1,"Nowadays with globalization and mobility of huge human beings to other countries, you should understand that in a specific country there could be many different people from other nationalities that would prefer to use the app in their native languages, therfore, setting up the app in a way where people select the country of living and a different language would be super and a great value to your app. Think about it."
1,Getting aggravated. When I search for something specific it gives me everything but what I'm looking for. Would like to be able to right something about certain things like when trying to contact Amazon it wants you to pick certain things but what I'm looking for is not on the list and I'm getting tired of receiving (WET PACKAGES.) When UPS made deliveries and it was raining they always covered them somehow. When trying to look at something and then try to go back it's says oops something went w
3,Keep your orders separate. I love Amazon but every time I have more than one item in my cart it confuses the delivery guy and is delayed for days. Still waiting for my glow sticks for Halloween and it's now delayed til NOV 2nd... Same day shipping my arse. From here on I will just deal with the extra garbage and pollution so my items arrive on time.
1,"Up until now I was very pleased with this app. Then I looked up something with my search engine. The item happened to be on Amazon UK. The app asked me if I wanted to switch to UK I said ""no"" and it switched me anyway. I've been on hold in chat with Amazon for an hour waiting for someone to help me switch it back to the US. I Uninstalled the app and waited a couple of days then reinstalled. Do far so good."
5,"The Amazon shopping app is a great app and a very helpful tool to have... it knows what you're interest are it is easy has everything in the world that you can possibly want. If you need anything that day théy got a lot of products with a prime subscription You get most items with free 2 day shipping. You can now use your EBT card , get your prescription s filled."
1,"Progressively getting worse yet more expensive! Why does the Music Home Tab deadend at the Music Unlimited ad? So, if I dont subscribe I cannot access my prime music or purchase new music by it's own? I'd rather pay the artists for the songs I enjoy than for your garbage service where I own nothing. Between both Amazon apps I cannot buy music, I'm just funneled back to ""Buy the Unlimited plan!"" Amazon dosen't care about the consumer"
1,"I've deleted the app, suspended all of my subscribe & save, and will not be ordering from Amazon anymore. Let me know when I can open the app without being bombarded with a lord of the rings ad or any ad and I'll use the app again. If you're going to impede my ability to get to Amazon within a split second, I don't want to use it."
1,"Amazon used to be the best. Now it's a ripoff. You pay more for prime but it's all overpriced and the shipping is slower. Why are we paying more for it to be worse? I miss low prices and fast shipping. Also, I had to take my card off my account because they wouldn't stop charging me for subscriptions to their other services. I didn't sign up for their services. I had to keep contacting them but it kept happening so I took my card off so they would stop."
1,"😡We see you Amazon. Prices are high and Besos is taking over 50% in corporate profits and paying no taxes. He can take less profits & keep prices low. But no, he prefers to let us suffer while he's yachting. 😡 Intrusive app. Search feature is actually a smoke screen that doesn't work. Sponsored items inundate site. Cannot find an item at a decent price unless it's sponsored and we don't buy sponsored items. We prefer the little guys' shops. Thank you."
1,"Worst Customer Service ever (chat only available within the app), search engine is randomly giving results, filters don't actually work... The app lags, its difficult UI is hard to navigate."
2,"For being the largest shipping service and shopping app you would think they would use their own shipping but they never do, they always use USPS and it never gets delivered on time and the USPS never tries to deliver it to your front door if you live in an apartment. The app itself is simple and easy to use but I don't recommend buying prime if all you do is buy stuff on Amazon, they never follow through with the 2 day shipping and use USPS instead of their own shipping service."
1,When using android Samsung phone the Amazon app chat box for customer service is covered by the on-screen keyboard unable to see what I am typing it is hidden below. Amazon shipping service suck especially when buying from them directly not 3rd party. They don't signature or update the package when delivered no matter the address local or international or bussiness.
1,"The app is gradually getting worse with each update, but the service itself is even worse. When I select a more expensive product just because its delivery is advertised as next day, or ""tomorrow before 1pm"", then you shouldn't be changing this after the purchase has been made. And it's not an isolated incident, as I experienced that with nearly all of my orders I made in recent weeks. Any other company would face a backlash from customers if they were changing the terms of contacts such way."
3,"I've had the app less then an hour and I'm already having issues, first it wont work if any other app or tab is open, even the app i installed it from, and when I was trying to resolve an issue in relation to two orders going to the wrong address as soon as the assistant had changed one, even though we had yet to discuss the other, the app shut me out of the chat and wouldn't let me back in. I have to say though the assistant I spoke to was amazing and this is in no way a reflection on them."
1,"I have deleted the app it is almost impossible to use. I had items in the cart as shown on the bar at the bottom of the screen. I could not see them, clear them or buy them. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I made one purchase on the German site. Then tried to make a purchase on Amazon UK same problem arose. I then used the browser where I could control the content of the cart and successfully made the purchase."
3,I am missing my prime button at the top of the screen and now when I search anything all the prices are missing I have to open each individual product to see. This new change is awful.
4,"Works well enough, but would be better with less pictures and adverts clogging up the screen when using it to try and see information about orders already placed...... its good for browsing/shopping, but a little bit laborious finding information about orders already 'in progress'. No major issues though - so still 4 stars"
1,"Although amazon still offers a wide range of goods its losing out to other online stores. The payment options are poor, why don't you use PayPal like every other store does? Barclays finance is a rip off!!! I cancelled prime I know longer shop enough to justify it."
1,"selling advertising is over-the-top annoying. Always some new way to be in your face or monopolize you list. Employee's need to substantiate their existence by always changing the website into some new sales tool that is not customer friendly, but instead overbearing!! Also: as an example: if you look up a flashlight with a lithium battery you also get flashlights without a lithium battery... It's like the wild -west of advertising with Amazon standing-by and doing nothing! ThePits!"
1,"I can never open ""my orders"" it just spins and spins. The filters don't actually filter or put anything how you ask it to. Orders haven't been shipping or getting delivered when it says it's supposed to be."
1,"Multiple Errors since last update. When trying to reorder items and I select add to cart, app gives an error message. When trying to add items to wish list, app gives an error message."
1,"just disgusted fron Amazon. Had an important issue, for two weeks trying to solve with their ""amazing customer care service"" but just told me that will call me back and never did. After a couple of times I even didn't try again, as was plain to see they were not going to fix anything. Had even paid for annual Prime subscription that can't use Just DISGUSTED"
1,"2 week deliveries -30 day returns (even when using Amazon Gift card),Clueless customer service, inaccurate pricing, software issues charging >electronic< insurance for sleeping bag!? The worst experience I've EVER had in my life is getting Amazon to fix a problem. I've actually had better service after I dropped my PRIME membership. Be ready to spend at least an hour on chat/phone,No matter what the issue."
1,"Prime shipping doesn't work anymore, not in my area, other friends are saying the same why am I paying for prime if I can't get 2 day shipping. I know it's possible because when I first moved here I got plenty of stuff in two days. Now it doesn't matter whether a prime is available or not on the product it takes three five seven ten days stuff to show up. I'm beyond frustrated & it might be time to cancel thx 2 the person who warned about the button I don't deal with that sht I hate it!"
5,I use Amazon all the time I have Amazon prime and it's amazing with prime my shipping times are so much faster even though without it it's not to long of waiting time. The only complaint I have is they took my review privileges away cause they claim they noticed odd review activity which I still don't understand. Overall the app is great I love it alot 😌
3,I wish I could give a 5 and hopefully things will change so I can. These days I have been disappointed in Amazon's delivery. I pay for prime and I have bought items that were a little more than I wanted to spend but it was promised to get it that day or night. All 3 times including tonight the items don't show up on time at all. What's the point of paying all that extra that I can't really afford that easily if you guys can't deliver what you promised?
3,"Love the app and how easy it is to shop and find things but could we get a ""Add to Wish List"" Option for saved for later items? Also, Could we get a saved for later option when ordering from whole foods through the Amazon app and have to remove items from current order but will go back later to purchase?!?!"
3,"I love this app. I rather scroll aimlessly through Amazon than social media anyday. However, the scams on there are starting to get ridiculous. We as the consumer should be allowed to report an item/seller that is a scam. The only reason I gave three stars is because you're able to get your money back through Amazon (I hope at least) which is good. But all these scams are making me want to try other shopping apps."
3,"Crashes every time I attempt to remove an item from my wishlist. Fixing this may move it up to a 4 star rating, but there have been several other glitches with orders in the past, so I can't give it a 5."
1,"You know what's frustrating as all heck, is paying for prime, 2 day shipping and it not coming within that time frame! If I wanted it 7 days later I wouldn't pay for prime! Get it together, I would understand if it was still 2020 and everyone was ordering mass amounts, but it's not."
1,"Why did you remove the Alphabetical scroll bar? It now takes ne whole 2 MINUTES AND 43 SECONDS to scroll to the bottom of my song library. It used to be instantaneous by just making one swipe to the ""Z"". On top of all that, your app is now constantly freezing music for about 5 seconds at random times. Fix this."
4,"Really like shopping with this website only problem is getting your items lots of time. But they do help you when this happens, only thing it gets tiring trying to prevent this from happening wish there was a solution to this whole scenario."
2,"I just reinstalled the app thinking why I removed it in the past. Now I remember: I can't download invoice, why is that?? so this app is not really an integrated solution. Deleting it again. What's the use if the website offers more (something with having more tools as a company too follow your clients)?"
1,"It signed me out and i can't log into my account. It made me start a entire new acount. Also i bought something 3 different times and it canceled the order each time, and didn't save it so i had to find it again."
1,Terrible search. Laggy. Lists won't load correctly. constantly hangs and crashes.how did amazon ever get so successful with garbage interface like this. spend some of the profits on a real app!
3,"There's no way to communicate from my side. A few hours ago, 1 item was cancelled, NOT from my side. No reason was offered for the cancellation. (Laser night lamp). A while before that,I had to cancel another order for outdoor floodlight (1 piece), as I had placed the order (4 pieces). I have old age issues lke hand trembling, erratic memory, forgetfulness etc. So much I have been buying in good faith. Giving a reason will surely be a better way"
1,"Be extremely careful. The hoops they are making me jump through after they made a gigantic mistake with an order I made,is 100% not worth the ease of ordering. Absolutely looking at possible legal action. Do not trust their costumer service dept at all. If you have to deal with them,Quadruple check with multiple reps the same day to make sure they did their job. Absolutely a joke at this point what they are forcing me to do.The app has SERIOUS issues with payments and external app links.Beware."
1,"Amazon Support is the worst - Called support line over a dozen times over the course of 2 months to figure out why none of my packages weren't arriving. Easily spent 10+ hours talking with them. They never resolved the issue, and have now offered to cancel my prime subscription - instead of figuring out why my packages aren't being delivered."
1,Amazon has forgot that they are getting paid yearly to provide better services in delivery. Amazon is optimized to let you pay more for a product thats for sure. Too much of AI has made it worse to search for something that you need. (Showing everything unrelated of the context) cheap stuff available at higher prices. Guys do you even have atleast credibility that prime you promised.
2,"Normally a good order experience, however this time was very unprofessional as the online chat help was awful; I reported a whole order missing but they are trying to make me fill out several different forms for the same shipping order. It's ridiculous, how do they all not have the same access to the emails we send? An now, I got 2 different replies over 1 of the 2 items needing to be refunded. I am considering canceling my Amazon Prime Account over this."
1,Unable to sign out. The overall site is no longer user friendly. I feel like my personal information and shopping is not secure and is being tracked. 80 percent of fashion items and other items are off brand and are coming from China. Not happy about that. Prefer supporting made in America companies. The quality of items I've been getting lately is poor. The ease of returns is a bunch of BS. It is not easier since every item has to be publicly scanned at your local UPS store.
2,It would be nice if Amazon allowed the free shipping and price selection from low to high on the main screen when you're searching for items. However you have to click the filter button and they have now removed the sort from low to high. Thanks
5,"Amazon shopping is the greatest there is. I was afraid to approach it pre-covid-19. But that's one good thing that came out of covid, me trying out Amazon. And I could not be happier! It's my first stop for everything. I don't even grab my keys for the car anymore, I grab my phone and open AMAZON. It's that easy and by the next day, it's here. Returns are just as easy as they are in the stores. 5 plus stars if I could."
1,Incredibly buggy 2 factor experience. I was required to find my old phone to sign in. Re-install the Amazon Shopping app. Then go into the settings and make sure notifications are enabled in this app... I don't even use this phone or app. So that is incredibly annoying to sign in on the web.
3,"Keeps opening listings I didn't click on. The screen is overly sensitive and I can barely scroll without things opening. It's not my phone because it only does it on the Amazon app. If I want to open something I will, don't force me to open listings. It does not make me any more interested or willing to purchase things so stop it."
5,"Amazon is the best! I have bought many stuffs on Amazon and everytime there is an issue with any of my orders, Amazon always offer me full refunds to return the items or partial refunds if the damaged items still works and I wanted to keep it. I haven't shop on eBay for a long time after realized how amazing Amazon Shopping is."
2,I usually have no issues but lately all my emails and alerts are coming to me in Spanish. I have checked to make sure my settings are correct and in English and they are. I contacted Amazon customer service and they were zero help. This is frustrating.
1,STOP CHANGING MY LANGUAGE! I keep having to reset this app from Spanish to English which is the language set on my device. I don't know why but every couple of weeks it changes and it's not intuitive where the language setting is so I keep having to relearn the location. No other app I have is changing the language on me just this one.
4,Experience is not bad but it's time you should add option of getting all the items together in one delivery and option for us to choose delivery date and time cause some people aren't there to receive the package when it arrives especially where I live and the nature of my job is such that I am mostly not at home or in the country. It's frustrating that 1 item arrives in 1 day the next item after 2.Kindly introduce the option of delivering all items together with the comfort of choosing a date.
1,"Their ""get it today"" over-priced delivery ""promise"" is a fake cash grab. Every rime I buy something through this shipping method it's always delayed and I end up having to cancel entire order and create a new one with regular shipping just to get it on time 😒 this has happened in a recurring pattern several times and it's to the point I'm making a complaint . Fix this!"
3,It was amazing until all these updates now its been acting up. I try to fix my list it flickers then freezes on a white screen. Also hate how they took away the giveaway section :( please fix this. I need to be able to update my list because that's how I get donations for my rescue. Would add image if I could.
3,"This app is 1 of the few shopping apps i got along with, simple and straightforward. But the latest update deleted my entire purchase history, including things i have being delivered today, so i cant track the items or return them in the app if theres a an issue. And all my wishlists are deleted, so there goes my christmas shopping lists.bottom line, was a good app but the update has destroyed it, its useless if i need to go on my browser to see my orders, delivery updates and issues."
1,"Up until today it used to sort your orders page by when they will arrive, but now it sorts them by when they were ordered and doesn't update to show if they were shipped or not. This is a huge pain especially when you have items that are pre-ordered months in advance and get buried further down the list."
2,"It's easier to do a Google search for items on Amazon than search for items in the app. Filters simply don't work, search shows items completely unrelated, there's is no option to exclude categories to further narrow down the search. Note 8, all updates on Oct. 2022."
1,The sponsored ads not directly related with my search make me crazy. It takes me double the time to find what I want or simply I give up. Please remove that. We will buy better and happier... Also improve search: it is disappointing that you are looking for example a blue light blocking lamp and 90% of results are just the opposite I want (blue light lamps)
1,"The app was fantastic until the last update. I can no longer shop the ""upcoming deals"" because the page all of the sudden is blank. I emailed support, but no response. I have certain deals that I try and watch out for, but now I can't. WHAT will it take to get this fixed?! I CAN'T shop anymore and now you're losing my business. ARE YOU HAPPY?"
2,"There's a bug now. I open the app, and there's either nothing in my cart, or saved for later, or shows me zero past orders... Either all three or a combination. at the same time I won't be able to track a package etc. Please fix."
5,"I love Amazon & have been a frequent shopper for years now. There's an enormous amount of different options/products, with prices ranging depending on what you can afford. That's one of the best parts for me! You can find the same high dollar item for less & not compromise on the quality of the item. I recommend to all my friends & family! Amazing customer service & delivery drivers! Quite possibly the BEST!"
4,Fairly easy to use but there's some options on Web not available in mobile . There is however some weird glitching when I view the orders page. E.g the text will continously jump and it gets worse as a I scroll and stop. Overall experience is good
3,"Lost 2 stars with update ! New filters are horrible, there are less of them and they are more difficult to navigate as they are poorly organized. Could we at least have the option of the old style?"
1,was doing for a while. had been a user of amazon prime for a while now maybe 2-3 years. i loved the next day delivery feature and customer support. but i don't know what happened but it seems like i have to wait 1 week for the item to be delivered to me. i know it depends but before only international items was supposed to take more to be delivered. i tried talking with customer Support but no help. it got me questioning why am i even paying 6 or 7$ per month for prime when i can use other.
1,"Amazon is not trustworthy and their customer service is trash. They do not honor their listings then send you things in a way that guarantee that whatever they can be bothered to send you is more often than not damaged beyond use. Before you buy anything on sale, check it's price on other sites. Chances are the sale price is either regular price in many other places or higher than it can be gotten in more than one legit place."
2,"The old app let me choose to play downloads off line. This new app keeping trying to stream my downloaded music. It sucks!!! I don't want to stream, I want to download and listen without Internet so I can listen to my music anywhere. This needs to be set up the old way."
2,Gonna Get Rid Of It Soon! Got my gift card balance to use and I'm done with them before next Prime billing cycle. And why does Amazon need to have so many permissions? I just don't think it is required too have some of the permissions listed. Out phones have become not so private even with all these terms and conditions with other apps and sites.
1,It has become extremely difficult to return items since they have removed Kohl's as an option. Now returns have to be done through whole Foods (really far away) or UPS store... The UPS store always has extremely long lines and takes like 30 minutes to get a return in.
5,"I have used Amazon for more than 10 years, since there is international shipping, is the best way to import things to Costa Rica. I would like to recommend to allow courier selection for international shipments, at least in my country using DHL is the standard one and the best courier I habe ever use, but if I try woth Priority, it gets expensier, and slower using other couriers that is not good at all... So I think that could enhance the customer service also"
4,It's totally awesome but it would be nice when they show you something at a cheaper price that they let you know it's a smaller unit than what you're actually was looking at I bought a rug and it tried to get me to buy one smaller for cheaper I didn't want the smaller I wanted the larger that was a little disappointing I ended up buying both
1,The app crashes on a DAILY basis. It's become a issue for the battery on this device. Device continually recommends uninstalling & reinstalling the app. Daily! Getting tiresome & a waste of my time. Fix it!!!!
1,"Been a regular buyer on Amazon for 4 years, always adhered to rules, when it came to feedback and reviews, always paid. Woke up one morning to find my account was restricted, queried this with their customer service only to be met with a Copy and Paste email not even detailing how or why so I could fix the issue. Will not be returning to Amazon, will be most certainly looking at alternative online markets."
1,"Always late deliveries even with Prime membership. Delivery times stated by Amazon are false advertising. Mostly low quality and criminally overpriced products. Not worth paying for Prime, there is no additional convenience. Needless to say, I canceled my subscription."
1,"I am really unhappy with them. They locked my account for no good reason. They requested all these documents proving identity. When provided them, they said it wasnt enough. Worse, i cant contact customer service through the app because i cant sign in until they finish the verification. So i am up the creek without a paddle. I dont know how to resolve this."
1,"Horrible. Do not order, they will always use Intelcom. They never deliver packages. Address not found. I've stopped ordering on Amazon because they cheap out and use a useless delivery company from Montreal, Quebec. Every single package, ""delivery address not found"". There is coordinates on my address, why aren't they delivering my packages."
1,"Not all features work, better/easier to use PC. Also the app keeps updating itself and wasting cellular data and precious space on device, really annoying. Consider uninstalling."
2,"STOP AUTO TRANSLATING MY SEARCHES TO MY LOCAL LANGUAGES FFS. Also stop changing my search for example if I search ""knippers"" then I don't mean ""knoppers"" I mean ""knippers"". So annoying I will probably stop using your app because of this. That's why I give it two stars, if you don't like it then let us disable auto translate and auto search change. Amazon becoming just like Google thinking they know what people think."
1,"Sort low to high never works. I'm looking for shoes, select a size, sort low to high; max out at 25-50 dollars and I'm getting pages of suggestions for 200 dollar trendy shoes. I'm looking for stuff on clearance and super reduced. Stop showing me stuff that I clearly have no interest in buying!! Please fix the sorting of high to low"
1,"Sinse the last update it's next to impossible to find an order. They divided it in months and years so your tapping in and out of needless pages. Plus it's also a nightmare to change countries. In Ireland we have to to avoid huge embargoes because of Brexit. Frustrating, unesseaary and annoying. Please change it back from this pointlessness."
2,"It's crazy that major navigation bugs have existed for months for a major app by a company such as Amazon! This app use to work fine before the redesign, now the tabbed navigation is really messed up the screen hierarchy gets infinitely deep so I'm unable to return to the head of each tab, and for example the backstack includes screens that shouldn't be included like verification screens."
1,Having to force stop every time want to use it. Keeps stopping mid songs. Starting to become very annoying. And yes have done an update thinking this would sort it but hasn't if anything its worse.
1,"Amazon just lies about shipping times now and the gaurantee is less than worthless, most products and reviews are false, and prime services cost more while being worth less every year. App is usually stable although link handoffs will try to open a web page half the time."
1,hello my Amazon app is continuing to stop working this last 2 months.. once I open the app nothing loads ..I have attached photo of what screen looks like once app is opened.. if I delete app and then reinstall it will work..however once the phone shuts down or is restarted the same thing happens again.. I'm running app on Android 11 on a one plus 6t phone.. everything is up to date and I'm not having this issue with any other apps.. please help  this is copy of email I sent
1,"Running slower than erosion. Every update makes the app WORSE. It worked fine, could shop for whatever you wanted. Now it takes 600 years for things to load absolutly sucks. I really don't understand why i pay for prime when the freaking app sucks so much. All four the sake of flashing more ads at us. I am getting closer and closer to dropping Amazon and prime"
5,i have had this app more than a few years and i absolutely love this app especially when you can order items for the next day delivery and easy to access if your not near a computer!! the only thing i wish they could add is having to add any bank account including venmo and be able to actually withdraw your amazon gift card balance directly and instantly to your bank to help cover other expenses if needed!!
1,"I found used item, I ordered the Matepad 11, I received it, but they delivered different, used tablet. box was already unboxed... This is the situation of Amazon.. Worlds standard.... This is not acceptable, I'm really disappointed... Costomer care is really irrespective about their costomers. I had to call them & 3 to 4 times, to get my refund.. Luckily I got it back. Only one person in the costomers service, a lady she was really good & were being polite. Thanks for that..."
1,They ripped my gf and I out of 200 dollars. They had a deal on the pixel 7 pro where you get 200 gift card with the purchase of one. We have proof of the deal with links and plenty of screenshots. They refuse to fix their mistakes. It is a sad way to run a business. I expected more out of them.
1,"Whenever you're trying to scroll up, on a spot that has an ad for scrolling left and right, you cannot. You have to touch PAST the ad (especially the amazon ads) to be able to keep scrolling."
1,"Since you guys did an update, the change if order and display of products is abysmally so wrong. No prices until you click into it. Sorry but I don't have time to waste looking for prices when they should be on the product. The display of products two at a time while scrolling down loses my confidence in Amazon as a shopper. I use eBay more now due to that update. Not my place to go to shop online nowadays. Going downhill. Such a shame."
1,Thieving bastards. My prime membership is ACTIVE and I get lots of shipping charges for items that are PRIME. Same thing for Prime Video. Everything has a price or membership. I use the apps 99% of the time. Wth pay for Prime when you're getting ripped off? 🤬
3,"I've been a prime member for a long time now, my only complaint is I'm tired of the app not opening my orders to allow me to conviently see what I ordered. I'm sure it's a strategy to make it more difficult to create returns and such but how about a update to fix that. Thanks"
5,"My go-to, #1 shopping app. Best deals ANYWHERE. As a low income mom it's nice to be able to find anything me or my family needs without wasting gas from a car I don't have, and without going out in public winding up having another panic attack or epileptic seizure. I've never had any issues with the app itself, delivery is mostly A+, and as I mentioned it's extremely convenient. Way to go, Bezos, devs and Amazon team.💛🎁☘️"
2,"2 months later with still ZERO help!...I do A LOT of shopping on Amazon. I like it for many reasons and I also dislike many things about it. The reason I'm rating 2 stars today is because it has been MANY MONTHS since I've been able to leave any reviews. I was never given an explanation, and have tried to contact them at the email address they provide for such issues with no reply. I take pride in writing helpful reviews and have waited long enough."
3,"I am kind of ticked off with this app, at the moment. I used to be able to use my kindle to buy books on the kindle app. Then they fixed it to where you could buy books on kindle...and then purchase them on the Amazon shopping app. Now I can't do either of them. So frustrating! Other than that...purchasing items off the app...I continue buy other things."
1,"Terrible app experience. Constantly slow, various UI elements don't work consistently or change without reason. The list of sellers isn't always the same as desktop interface. Too many negative experiences with the app to recommend, much prefer the web interface."
1,"Two step verification recovery does not work. I changed my number and can't log in anymore. Unable to get any help or get in contact because website goes in a loop. Clearly an error. Clicking on recovery link takes you back to sign in page and when you try to recover your password it, again sends a message to old number and when you try to get in contact with customer service.... It takes you to sign in page. And round you go. Fix your recovery website please!"
1,"They suck, screwed up 4 orders over the summer, screwed up a book order this week. Don't tell you that pre-order stuff isn't actually paid for when you order it, doesn't come out of your account until it's actually ready to ship. Overdrawn account because of that, thanks Amazon. Sincerely, Disabled Veteran"
1,"The same way Amazon are trying to dictate what music I want. They are now trying to dictate what I want to buy too. How patronising! If they don't re-evaluate how they are treating customers, I will have to look at cancelling Prime and deleting all of their cumbersome and now much less desirable apps."
2,"I use Amazon almost weekly. I love shopping on here for a variety of items. However, the app itself has a ton of glitches. Every app on my phone works great except Amazon. If the glitches get fixed, it would be a 5 star review for sure."
1,It's just awful to find a product in the app. The filters don't work properly and the products are just repeated with a lot of sponsored items. It's a real pain to use the app
1,"Ughhh! Soooo many issues! Sometimes the app will fail/refuse to put items into the cart. And can't even get an Amazon return label to print at FedEx from a brand new phone, meaning a so-called ""free"" return isn't really FREE because I have to pay the store to print a label! And when I try to pose a product question, I get this error message: ""Sorry, an error occurred when we tried to process your request. Rest assured, we're working to resolve the problem as soon as possible."" !?!?"
5,time is money and money is time..I love having amazon at my fingertips to save me the precious time and money to get things done and helps meet lots of my goals and even helps our business with the speed of prime and a business account. No need to go anywhere just click n place your order n your product arrives very soon. thanks amazon!!! Try it you'll definitely love it..don't forget the daily deals especially if you're tech savvy!!
1,The last update changed the lower right hand corner from account and order information to shortcuts that are not relevant to your purchases and you can't change them. I called tech support and there is no way to change them. Very ill conceived and not user friendly. Shortcuts should be able to be changed by the user and also be relevant. The app was fine the way it was... why did they have to change it?
2,"Good for shopping, but membership management not supported in the app? Come on, Amazon. Also, it's be nice if there was a dark mode setting or at least one that reacts your system settings to save energy."
1,"The app needs dark mode desperately, also please remove that search with photo option from being so close to the normal search bar. It's frustrating for larger phone users who hit that rather than the normal search option by accident. Quite frustrating."
5,"Most convenient place to shop - IMO. You can find just about every legal item on here, as well as items intenteded to go along with items that are not of legality lol. But it always gives you an ETA for your package and it even allows progress tracking. My favorite shopping outlet even over in person shops, I still prefer Amazon"
3,I don't understand why the app isn't more intuitive. I have to scroll through all these recommendations for things like pets and books and other things I've never bought from Amazon. It should at least give me the option to remove categories from the homepage. The only recommendations are for stuff I've already bought.
1,"Awful, awful, awful app. If you hit the menu button, nothing happens. If you hit the account button, nothing happens. Not surprisingly, the home screen and the basket do actually work (the Amazon Fascists will always make sure that works if nothing else)."
1,Stale app and poor customer service. Never pay for the better shipping cause it'll never get here when it's supposed to unless your a prime member and even then it'll be late a lot of the times. The Searcy results are awful most of the time showing stale and unwanted items when looking and all around clunky app that is just a copy and past of the website.
1,"What happened to this app seriously it worked fine in the past but now it's completely broken I tried to buy something by using the scan credit card feature and the app will just kick me for no reason I tried to delete and install it again but nothing works and the search bar don't show you the things you wanna look for but instead stuff that's recently on sale, it's also hard to track the item and more often than not it's either 1 day or 2 days late."
2,"I don't know what's going on, but for about 2 weeks the app keeps showing nothing in my cart, even though I have things saved in it. Or when I click on my wish lists it shows none, again even though I have about 10 lists because I like to organize things into categories. I have about 7 things on order atm, but when I look at orders It says I have none? I've uninstalled the app multiple times and when I log back in it's fine for an hour or two, then shows nothing again.. very frustrating.."
2,"Within the past weeks, I no longer receive delivery alerts, which is frustrating. I rely on alerts to make sure items aren't stolen from my porch. I checked and all the notification settings and permissions are still there, so the app must have changed!"
1,"Horrible Experience. Lost access to thr phone on file and the password, ended up calling customer service and they said my account is dormant and can no longer access the account, to top it all off gift cards were put on account upwards to $50 and they won't credit me for my money or help me out in any way. Again, horrible experience"
1,"Terrible, I used to love Amazon but lately you pay for 2 day prime shipping but yet the packages usually come late, alot of times they come damaged, sometimes with missing parts or not at all. These are not the only issues but these are the ones im most frustrated with. It's only worth keeping for prime video and photo storage."
1,"Terrible Search App... search something in specific and it throws up items that aren't even relevant to what I was searching for... Overall RATING IS A MINUS 10 ACTUALLY... Amazon is highly overrated especially with its products generating from third parties and usually the products are counterfeit products, which Amazon really cares less about just as long as they get their percentage out of your money..."
3,"I think it's since the last update, I can't see return details like the code that they scan at the store or any other details. When I click to see the return, it just takes me to the order details. I had to print it from my desktop and I hope that the clerk at the store will be able to scan it. Please fix that feature."
1,"Update: it took hours....a couple calls, then forever to get it ""authorized"". Whatever....they say its on there but who knows! Over it. *FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! I bought a Prime acct, and have ordered a few things. Then it came online and asked me to use the app. It promised me a $30 coupon if I would switch to shopping via the app. BUT once I did that, and the app was in my phone, they refused to give me a coupon advertised! Bad way to treat customers, Amazon!"
1,Got to pay for delivery even though Im already paying for service. I have to spend over $35 just for delivery when all I wanted was something I needed that cost under $20. Lately been delaying delivery but get no refund or credit when item arrive late or not at all. They will use wrong payment you get fee's from credit card🤯 because of what they do with no remorse the evil things they do. I really starting to hate these companies. Price gouging their food items really other stores is less.
1,"ZERO STARS After promised refund, no refund. DO NOT THINK THIS HUGE CORP WILL NOT STEAL FROM YOU. Amazon bait and switch on shipping charges. 2 item checkout page says free shipping over $25. Add 1 $2 item. 3 item check out page $26 , buy. Amazon splits order into 2 shipments $26 purchase now $37. Have had small orders/shipments split like this previously, never really noticed before, never looked at it, have you? App does it's job very well app gets ALL stars."
1,"I think it's one of the worst every e-commerce app. It is still running on an ancient design, bad page layout and the extremely bad payment process. My payment always gets failed and one has to wait for the email to make repayment and it gets even more complicated when you order multiple then good luck figuring out how to do repayment."
2,"In the past month or so, there's bunch a bunch of issues with my orders. I've received broken items, incorrect items, or even missing items. I ordered a 2 pack of dishwasher deodorizers, and they sent me an empty package. I'll be looking into other online merchants now since more than half of my Amazon orders have had problems recently."
2,"App itself is great. No issues. Five stars is for Amazon app itself. Two stars for how Amazon prices. To all those who are somewhat savvy on online shopping, Amazon is usually not the lowest price anymore. There are many other apps and code base price webscraping capabilities that can price compare items. I have saved hundreds of $$ shopping around. Check eBay, walmart, Alibaba, etc. Happy price hunting. Also note Amazon changes price based on demand."
1,"App keeps starting support chats in the background when opened, which can't be accessed or closed. Notifications of support responses also doesn't take you to that chat, but opens a new chat and requests a new agent. App is obviously poorly built and broken. Oh, and unlike every other app, you can't uninstall by holding down on the app icon, they disabled that for this app (to deter you from uninstalling, so Amazon can continue to track your browsing habits in other apps)."
1,"Incredibly frustrating being sent on a circular, never-ending automated ""chat"" option just trying to get the app to use my correct and legal name. I can request a phone call back at a later, unspecified time, except I'm hard of hearing and that does me no good."
1,"Cheaters, when you choose a low to high prices (even though you have a filter) they give you the most expensive prices. Thinking of canceling the subscription (amazon prime) it's not even worth it anymore. I come here looking for the better prices, not to be tricked into high prices 👎🏽"
2,"Not worth the money. Orders rarely make it within the two day delivery window for prime products, despite both the subscription and markup for two day delivery. And if it takes a week+ to get to you there's no refund or compensation, or option to return the order. sucks to be you, you pay a subscription and mark up for nothing."
1,It keeps saying that there are just the basic wish lists that you get when you first make an account but if I login on any another device it says that the wish lists I made are there and that I can add things the them when to the app they outright just don't exist and I can't look at or add things to them and it is very annoying. Please fix this Amazon!
1,"Started playing ads on splash screen on app launch. I already pay for Prime and spend more than I care to admit on Amazon, but if the ads continue to stand between me and something I want to buy/shop for then I'll happily move on. Edit: Looks like it took 3 days to reverse the LOTR full screen ad on launch. I wonder if that faux-pas ended up coinciding with a dip in user engagement/sales."
1,"Please revert back how 'add to list' works. There's a giant orange button for it now, great. Too bad it's functionally useless. It just adds to your one main wishlist, instead of allowing you to select which list it goes too. Then I have to open the wishlist anyways and move it to the correct list. So unnecessary."
1,"App seems to be broken again. I often switch between multiple countries, and for some reason, I can't check on orders for other countries right now. It's just showing the orders for one country. If I switch to a different one, it still just shows the same orders."
1,Had no issues with Amazon until my account was locked. I purchase and use Amazon coins twice before the account got locked. Call the number to get my account unlocked and they would send me an email within 24 hours to my account unlocked. I got it unlocked and tried to use my coins again. So had to repeat the process. Never got an email from Amazon. Not sure why I have to wait to contact them after they send me a message. It been 2 months since I order anything off of Amazon and life goes on.
1,"I installed the app only 3 days ago and ordered 3 items. Today, they irreversibly closed my account saying ""not meeting the terms of our Conditions of Use"". I did nothing wrong to cause an account closure! I'm really disappointed in Amazon and in Jeff. It goes without saying that they didn't even explain what points were violated, that's expected, as nothing was violated!! I'd rate this app 0 if it was possible. Don't recommend anyone installing it, as you can lose all your digital purchases."
1,"Absolutely trash. Already zero quality moderation on listings, now I have to scroll for pages to get past the hot garbage that is: prime exclusive, or prime early release... I'm trying to buy a freaking genetic phone charger... There's no such thing as an early release when the device itself is a Chinese knock off product. Amazon has way, way too much power."
2,"More and more often now, when I look for something; tools, clothes, jewelry for my wife, mostly what comes up is cheap Chinese reproductions, or bad Chinese products. Not sure what's going on here, but I'm going to start looking somewhere else. The deal on the shipping just isn't worth coming back for anymore."
2,"Hope Amazon makes app better hard to find items mainly shows items that I have no interest in and hard to refine items want to look at. IE looking at HDD hard show lists on app +wastes space on screen for stuff with no interest, but works on PC for similar drives fine, Got each sizes booked marked so I can check out. App Could be much better."
3,"Desastrous updates. I don't know what you guys did, but the app stays stuck in one country. I'm shopping in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, but when I go to another country everything or just about everything gets stuck on the country I was before. Closing and opening the app again only fixes this about ten percent. Utterly annoying. Please unupdate asap!"
3,"Every time I load the app I get a nag screen trying to sell me the benefits of Prime, and that I'm unable to sign up to Prime in the mobile - even though I already have Prime! Clearing this screen takes ages, almost as if the app blocks input or the back button for a short while. Absolutely terrible UX."
3,"My only issue is too much advertising and other goods on sale on the screen. Get rid of half of it and it will run faster and perhaps those complaining about lag and other freezing issues might have their problem alleviated! Whoever designed the layout for portable devices needs their head read. Portable devices do not have much RAM memory to load up screens as PC'S do, therefore make it less clostraphobic and less demanding on memory by getting rid of the unrelated information."
1,Honestly amazon has been completely down hill since they started using there own delivery ppl. Ive had prime for almost 10 yrs and never lost a package but in the last few weeks have gotten wrong orders three times and now have a package that was lost in transit that i wouldnt have even known about if i didnt contact them. Its getting ridiculous at this point to pay for subpar service and still not recieve what i ordered in a timely fashion.
3,Use this app a lot. Like the convenience of shopping for almost anything and having it delivered. Learned that you can't rely on the listed delivery times. Wait all day and get a notification saying they're sorry the order is late. Then it's rescheduled for the next evening. Will start comparing prices with my local stores from now on.
1,I have been a prime member for years never had any problems till now. I WILL BE CANCALINGMY MEMBERSHIP due to 1) it says that they can't ship to my address and to enter a Canada postal code. 2) prices are outrageously high. A pack of 8 pens I normally get for $10 is now $68. 3) Every thing I had in my cart has disappeared. 4) my order history/ previous orders have disappeared. Saying I've never ordered anything when I just ordered a phone case last week.. Im very disappointed in Amazon
1,Brand new issue the app is as good as they service. As a prime member the agreed time has never actually reached 10 times the goods late 2 to 3 days Where is the prime in that. New issue same rating and I would give minus if I could. The latest update is buggy product image horizontal scroll is lagging. It's most annoying experience
2,"i have been using my Amazon Prime to buy a lot of things all this past 2yrs +... an alot of broken, damaged, badly packed items have come last couple months. Also searches lately are getting WORSE! It always shows wrong items and search criteria NOT helpful! This is a 5star company giving me 2 star service and they need to get it together! (6 mo.s later an it's worse- the list system is HORRIBLE!)"
1,"Awful service. My account was hacked and over the course of 3-4 months, I called several times with different people and was always assured the problem was fixed or going to be fixed. I was promised a follow up call or email and it never happened. They have my family and I paying for an account that I can no longer access. They cannot retrieve it or even delete it so I can create a new one. Its so hard to get in touch with them and when I have, no one has done a single thing to fix this."
3,"I am having an extremely hard time getting screens to open in this app. This just started occuring about 2 weeks or so. No matter what I do to improve this process, including updating software, boosing phone memory, clean cache, etc this problem persists. I am beyond frustrated at this point."
1,Every time I open this app now I have an ad for lord of the rings??? I pay for prime I should NOT have to be subjected to this ad Every. Single. Time. I. Open. It! Now is this the beginning? I'm going to have ads pop up in on Amazon shopping? Like I don't get that enough everywhere else. Please make it an option to not see ad again.
5,The best for shopping dependability delivery and support. Whenever I've had a problem. Amazons always had my back with anything help was there for me. 24/7 they help you out of any situation. Amazon is the best with website shopping and in there support. Most important they're honest in their dealings with customers and sellers alike. And that is a very important commodity in dealing with any business today. Thanks Amazon for all your great customer support & 24/7 help.
1,"Can't see my order history or pending orders, keep getting the oops screen. This has been happening for months. Missed the return window for quite a few orders because of this issue. I have emailed customer service about this issue but nothing has improved. Please fix it. UPDATE 9/13/22 STILL CANT SEE MY ORDERS!"
1,Very bad experience. I made an order for books ..the transaction is doubled (not the bank( but because the shipping fees tripled without any reason ..then tried to cancel it ..not accept cancellation ..dont know why...it was just few minutes later of course not shipped yet or even assembled. Now i have to pay about 3 times the price of the book for no reason
1,"I am overwhelmed by the number of wrong orders i had to return since souq has become amazon The number of times that I ordered something and turned out something different from what the title or description said or the photo is daunting. The user experience especially the filter is barely useable. I remember writing about ""souq is now amazon"" on a well known online blog and how i was excited about it, but now ai regret it. I'm switching to noon and jumia."
1,So I can't buy kindle (amazon) books through the amazon app which is convenient and makes me inclined to purchase more... Now I have to open amazon on my laptop and do it that way which makes me never want to use kindle. Seems pointless for a shopping app where you can't buy things. It'd be great if you could come to an arrangement with Google and go back to letting people buy straight from the kindle app like we can with the Google play books app.
4,Great app. Customer service is helpful. One place you could improve on though is the payment confirmation information. It does tend to confirm a payment and then later say it failed. Wish I could learn of the failed payment immediately so I could rectify it right away.
1,"tl;dr: Dishonest design decision that led to a poor user experience. This app does not let you manage your subscriptions. Between the browser and app versions, the subscriptions page is identical with the exception of the ""cancel subscription"" button. There is no excuse for this malicious design practice. User experience should always come first, but Amazon clearly prefers to waste your time to deter you from removing subscriptions."
4,"Changed review from one star to four. The interface is... way better. Doesn't lag as much, way more responsive. I find it pretty acceptable now. I no longer feel frustrated every time I visit a product page."
1,It feels like some scam in the process with discounted product from china. It just disappear in the way and neither amazon or the currier knows where is the shipment. Is amazon keep the shipment in their store here to sell again with higher price. Why amazon generate one tracking for more than one shipment This is the way steal your product and at the end you will get refund and the seller will lose. While amazon or one prime member will get your product delivered right away on next or same day
2,Both Amazon Shipping/prime video are aggravating apps. There are a lot of issues. But the most aggravating is the purchasing of book/movies. The apps do not support purchasing Kindle books or prime video movies. You have to use the desktop site. Makes no sense. Very inconvenient.
3,"Payment deducts when shipped. Which can lead to banking issues. If I order something from Amazon it's your money Amazon. The money should not get put back in a person's account until it ships. A person with plenty of money is certainly ok with these practices but for low income people it is a bad practice. Spent money is simply that. If you order something and it takes 2weeks to ship, that money reflected in a person's account is a portion considered spent. Even though it's not reflected hold..."
1,"I have no problem with the app, but the customer service that comes along with it is terrible. I ordered a package that was supposed to be delivered between 4am and 8am it never arrived. Cool I understand things happen I go to the app and check the status of my package. I am informed by the app to reach out to customer service. They are no help either they just repeat the same message as the app. I then as the ask representative for the policy concerning overnight delivery which she doesn't know"
1,"This review is more for Amazon as a whole, my credit card information was stolen 3 times when the only place I use it is on the Amazon app, none of those times was I warned that there was suspicious purchases or anything, the only way I found out is when my actual purchases would be declined because someone maxed my card out. And how it's been over a month since I returned an item and still haven't received my money back. I use to like using company but lack of security has fully stopped me."
2,"Everything was working fine, now can't get on to orders now for some reason to view when order is coming just keeps the loading screen on and never loads. Also very disappointed that prime has gone up multi billion pound company what you need it for or I'd of at least kept it the same price for your customers that have been with you for years like me, spent thousands on your site got a amazon credit card and everything. Would like to think you would look after your long serving customers."
3,"Overall a good app, but I find it quite messy to navigate and search options are limited and/or don't match the product. Price categories are one example where I can't select anything specific and I only get 5 predetermined ranges."
2,"I noticed that Amazon is trying to fool people. A lot of people are busy and buy and returning a lot. Amazon has a habit, once you return a few items, after a few days, change your status of the item, as if you would not returned, there is only information about the item delivered to your home, but the information of return disappears. My advice - be careful and check all Amazon returns statuses and always keep a return receipt and don't delete your e-mail too early ,lest you get scammed ."
1,"I'm not really sure if it's the app or Amazon but I would like to do my shopping myself and if I save a cheap product in my list I don't like it being replaced with ""the same item"" for double the price (and no its not because of color selection or size I thought so too)"
1,"09/22/22 update last review is more applicable than ever - sucks even worse. Don't need waving icons or GUI so animated takes 8-10 sec to load each time. Spend more time waiting for the app. Been suffering through this app for a month. Officially the slowest , un-user friendly app ever. Sad! Amazon used to be a great shopping experience now its sucks."
1,"Your mobile app absolutely sucks. At times, it is extremely slow and unresponsive. Other times, it is completely unsuable and won't load products at all. I'm surprised a company with the resources of Amazon cannot develop a functional app. It's sad!"
4,"I normally avoid online shopping as find some sites difficult but you can speak to an actual person who helps with anything, automotive chats don't answer your questions and texting so much hurts so for me this is a big help. They have lots to choose from and deliveries can go to local drop off point if your not in.. it's just easier.. thanks"
1,"Made a grocery order through the Amazon app. Driver was supposed to be here just after 12pm. 4 hours later after receiving a message saying they're going to refund and another conflicting email saying they're going to attempt redelivery, they say sorry by crediting my account £5! Patronising. I'm definitely not renewing prime and will use eBay and another supermarket as much as possible."
1,The pages simply don't ever load. The app crashes every new page opened. This app is just trash functionally and aesthetically.. it looks so many years old it could really do with a fresh new coat of paint - and two coats of cleaning/polishing/reorganization
1,I downloaded it three days ago and literally have not been able to use it. It keeps saying 'oops page not found'. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it. I have connected to wifi. I have full bars. Nothing is working. Horrible experience
4,It's what you would expect. For a shopping experience I would say it's average. One problem I have: The home page often doesn't show relevant items. I think that product recommendations should be based on search's only.
4,The app works just fine. It's easy to navigate and it does what it's supposed to do. As with most things nowadays nothing's perfect. Today on 9/21/2022 I had a delivery and the delivery person did not follow instructions. They left my food on the ground when I asked for it to be placed in the cart provided. If I don't put my food on the ground no one else should. The drivers are dry for whole foods are better. They packed frozen food better and I'll pay them extra money.
1,"Update: links dont open to the item on Samsung s22 Ultra. The app opens but I usually have to open the link again to get it to go all the way to the item the link is pointed to. 1 star till fixed. Please add a ""orders widget"" so I don't have to keep up a separate note in google keep, to keep track of my orders and delivery dates. While you're at it, please include a description of the items I purchase in the emails you send to me about my purchases, instead of only sending the order #."
1,"New filters are confusing and complicated. I can't put in a price range for what I want the prices to go between. Notifications are inconsistent/nonexistent. Overall, the app has become an afterthought."
3,"Amazon looses my packages and wont replace them! They repeatedly deliver my stuff to my elderly neighbor, who insists she hasn't seen them, then I select missing and it tells me I'll be charged to replace the missing item id I don't return it! I have tried changing delivery instructions and they are in BOLD. It doesn't matter because (clearly) no-one reads them. I hate Amazon's lack of customer service so much! Thanks, with extra sarcasm!"
1,I returned an unopened watch. The pickup agent checked if I had returned everything by breaking the seal in front of me and the app says the packet did not reach them even after 10 days. After some days the customer care people say that they recieved wrong item. I did not get the refund. It was a very bad experience. I lost trust in this company. I would rather pay 100-200 extra in a regular shop that ordering in this app.
1,Amazon is progressively selling more and more customer returns (used) items as new and the products arrive with visible damage and wear. If I wanted to go thrifting I definitely don't need to pay $150+ a year for that honor. They are cutting a lot of corners which makes no sense considering how much gross revenue they make per year.
3,"the app keeps on closing whenever i change the currency setting. when i try to relaunch the app, it doesn't. i have to uninstall then re-install, which doesn't solve the problem at all (the app still closes after currency setting change). i hope this can be fixed... SOON."
1,"Just a horrible clunky, cluttered, badly organised application. The pinch to zoom feature is absolutely awful and does not operate smoothly. If I could rate zero stars I would. Needs a rewrite from the ground up."
3,"This app used to be better, the order tracker is becoming useless, it can tell you your package is 6 stops away, then turn up 5 hours later or sometimes tell you it's 8 stops away but it was delivered an hour ago. The rest of the app works well, but the tracker is at best a very wild guess"
3,"I can't change my name across the entire app. I've swapped it to my preferred, but it still calls me by my deadname whenever I hit the person icon at the bottom of the screen. This is profoundly upsetting since it causes me major discomfort when using the app and I run the risk of outting myself to others as a result."
1,The app is underperforming. Most of the tabs are not loading data but the cute puppies saying something went wrong... I am using android device and the app has no updates to be actioned so I am not sure.. but this behaviour happened in the past 1-2 months and I am very very very dissapointment. I can't use the app .. rather to logging to a computer/laptop and load the website.. and I am paying for prime as well...I worte to the support team but no response back....
1,"September 2019 was my last update. 3 years later and nothing has changed. I made 3 purchases 1 from here and 2 from 2 other apps. 1 of them is from overseas and they have all shipped and tracking shows they will all be here by the 17th - 20th , but the one from Amazon say we will let you know when in stock. Look the item up it says there are 16 available.Just like the last few times I've ordered. I will be uninstalling Amazon after this order do to the fact it takes forever to get the order."
1,REALLY unhappy being bombarded with ads for Lord of the Rings EVERY time I open the app. Even more unhappy that every time I leave app open and go to another app what I was doing is erased and I'm back to the home page again and ANOTHER video plays. You make a ton of money. Stop annoying your best customers with ads. Just stop it.😡
1,"Notifications are now being used for ads. When turning off notifications in other apps, you can select what you want to see and not. I still want to see delivery notifications, but I don't care about air pods on sale...."
1,"There is no option in the app to review the delivery service and not the seller. I ordered a gift for my son's birthday and chose Amazon day delivery instead of 2 day since I had over a week (no rush at the time). It never showed up, completely disappointed. Every time I pick next day delivery, it takes at least 2 days. Every time I pick Amazon day delivery (Thursday), it never comes on that day."
3,"Not liking the October 2022 update. Have lost the shortcut, from the bottom right hamburger button, to get to orders, my list etc. Now shows 3 brightly coloured large shortcuts. Always used these before to navigate account and now requires more effect. Step backwards I'm my opinion"
1,"App item search lists very little compaired to website. Found deep fryer I wanted on website, had four warranty options you could choose. Web says I can save $10 if I use the app to order. App search lists one page of deep fryers, mine is not listed. Search by specific name and it does show up, only one warranty available and not the one I want. Had to get what I wanted in my cart on website and checkout using the app. I would recommend using website any day over this laughable attempt at an app"
1,"Amazon has turned to garbage. Missing items, wrong items, bad customer service, or no customer service at all, damaged packaging, packages not being placed in intelligent areas etc etc. Really bad these days. I'm also very confident they control reviews on here since they're buddies with Google and they all love controlling the information we receive."
1,"Would rate 0 stars if I could. First order since the update never got packed in the warehouse and shipped, had to call and reorder the item 3 times. And ever since then I'm not able to purchase anything in the app I have to do it on the computer if I want or need something from Amazon. Its bs. Not convenient at all, completely and totally useless"
1,"Please Go back to the way it was before! Omg I can barely shop on Amazon anymore! It crashed more than it does anything else. And don't get me started on how long it takes to load a page now. My internet is fine BTW. I've Uninstalled re-installed, etc still SUCKS!!"
1,"Amazon is now forcing me to watch videos of ""influencers"" touting its products, blocking a significant percentage of my phone's screen. I see no way to close out of these videos. As someone who is repulsed by the concept of complete strangers trying to tell me what to wear or buy, this unwanted ""feature"" makes it less likely that I'll be spending money at Amazon. Why not just give us an app that allows rational search results? (Another thing Amazon's app and web site are really bad at.)"
2,"I don't usually upgrade (default is switched off) for some reason I updated to this version & frankly it's rubbish! I don't need an animated thumbs up, I need it to work seamlessly & without the lag I now have. Not only is the lag dreadful but if I click on my account more often than not, it fails to update. If I search for a product via voice it takes much longer or fails all together. I wish I'd never upgraded, maybe an Aptoid downgrade is warranted..."
2,This app is terrible if you want to use it for shopping at Amazon Fresh. Totally UNintuitive and definitely not designed by somebody who would be considered a savvy supermarket shopper. I'm not going to spend an hour listing what it cannot do properly or the few things that it does do properly.
1,"Every time I try to order anything it says my account has been closed. If I go online onto the website, no problem, the account that I've had for years is just fine. I've been in touch with Amazon customer service twice about it and they haven't been able to help. Its completely useless to me now."
1,The app is SO SLOW. Like incredibly slow with everything. The worst is trying to remove things from a wishlist. My goodness me it takes like 30 seconds to process every action like it's trying to solve all the world's problems.
4,"So far it's been okay no real problems except for audible. Every month I had a $16 charge even though it been close to a year since I dropped it, audible told me to talk to the card issuer the card issuer told me to talk to audible, so I locked the card and lo and behold, the charges ended. I have an app group on my phone eBay, Amazon, Etsy and Google Play store I move from Amazon to eBay. I check the sellers on eBay and I watch the reviews on Amazon they're both pretty much equal."
1,"Beware: they've started showing ads through push notifications. There's no separate notification channel for these ads, so the only way to disable these ads is to disable all notifications from the app - even the useful shipping and delivery notifications. Total abuse of their customer's attention."
1,Awful i feel like amazon just helped someone scam me. I orderd an item and later when i was checkong my orders too see when it would come in it was replaced wuth some random item. I tried too fix the issue but all i could do was cancel the order. The items that replaced my order arnt even avaiable items. Ive spent forever tryong too reach a person too explain my issue because their customer service only gives select options of things i can say and none of them are my issue.
1,"It's hard to imagine a worse app. It's brutally slow, to the point where it takes 30 seconds to load a new picture because I changed colors. User videos don't play. Removing the swipe in from the left destroyed the usablility. Only google could have done it worse."
1,This went from the fastest shipping app to unreliable service. And unreliable shipping times. Not only are half the items not worth the price from false advertisements but the few items you cannot even get same day shipping anymore. At best I get over night and about one fifth of those items actually arrive on time. What the owner/founder reached billionaire status so now the company and services go to hell. I am really really beginning to hate this company and my lack of purchases shows that.
1,This app continues to get more bloated and unresponsive as they fill the pages with my garbage. It's hardly usable anymore and has actually started crashing. No other app gives me any problem close to this.
1,"Let's face it, this app buggy, slow, and the UI is awful and at times misleading. Search filter is broken, shipping prices and expected delivery times have gone from precise forecasts to just guesses, and now full screen ads?"
1,"I'm a Prime customer, but not for long! Two words... DARK MODE! We need a new UI like on Prime Video! This app is junk! I have the notifications turned off for certain things, but I still receive them anyway. Amazon sucks! Use eBay instead!"
2,"Amazon has fallen off... I'm tired of paying for Prime to have 2 day delivery, yet my packages are always late. When you call customer service it is always some excuse as to why they are running behind and want to offer you a $5 credit. I don't want the credit I want you to hire reliable people and stand behind your one or two day prime delivery!! Come Amazon get it together!!!"
3,"The reason it gets 3 stars is because the delivery people don't always know how to follow instructions especially the ones in wildwood, mo. I understand we live on the 3rd floor but placing it in places like a ""safe place"" but they don't tell you were that is or it's been delivered and you can't find your package anywhere!! That's not okay at all. Please take the time and actually do you job correctly."
1,"Sadly, Amazon's own shipping is slow and unreliable. Vendors that use USPS, FedEx or UPS have better delivery results. If Vendors use Amazon's own shipping service, it rarely takes less than 5 days for Prime. Prime shouldn't even be offered on Amazon shipped items, I have had to cancel several order because of delayed or lost items. About to cancel another order because of a delay shipping on Saturday and the items are sitting at an Amazon Processing Center 4 days later and hasn't reshipped yet."
1,"I can't stand having to constantly see a video ad for their Rings movie. It's bad enough that it opens every time the app opens, but then it plays while looking at something else in the app."
1,"Amazon, you just lost 1 customer. Stop updating the app to push your worthless products. Says inspired by me, but I've never looked at any of that bs, and the stuff that did offer suggestions is now scrolled so far down and I used it. Going back to ebay and I'll gladly start spending and extra 25% more to shop else where."
1,No dark mode on Android 12. When in dark mode on S22 Ultra this app stays light why? Plus the search function is less than useless half the time cannot refine to search specific items. The search function is now totally USELESS. Amazon promote items they make most from regardless of your search criteria - do one Amazon hard sell me nothing more.
1,"Why get rid of ""date added"" on Friends gift lists? I have used this function to shop for family for birthdays and holidays for years, but without date added it is useless IMO. I don't trust it to be current so will find something else. Also, please provide a way for me to give feedback like this without leaving a one star review. Your customer service is great when attached to an order, but nothing else. Hope this catches someone's attention."
2,"Update has made app SO SLOW and freezes often. Update? For the worse! *That was my June update, this October update has been even worse. 😣 Buggy in so many other ways now as well. Please stop *fixing* a good thing. I LOVE the app when it works! ETA, in the past 6 weeks I have had 2 packages delivered to other addresses in my neighborhood and 1 other instance 4 months ago. Thank god I have honest neighbors! In over 10 years of amazon deliveries that had only happend one time before!"
2,"Several times over the past few weeks, the Orders page doesn't load and looks like it's refreshing but ultimately nothing loads. It'll resolve itself for a few days but then the issue returns. Double-checking internet connection and restarting phone doesn't help"
3,"I am constantly having to uninstall and reinstall the app after updates as they do not install correctly. I turned off auto-update. When I do not update, the app stops functioning. The issue constantly repeats. 1. I update the app, 2. The new update has some kind of failure loading update, and the app malfunctions, 3. I uninstall, and 4. I reinstall the app. I might as well not update and just uninstall and reinstall whenever there is an update available. Irritating."
1,"I am absolutely disgusted with the repeated failure of Amazon to deliver packages as promised. I pay for Amazon Prime and over 99% of that I buy from Amazon is Prime. But I constantly have packages go missing, reported as delivered (or left in a safe place) when they're not. I have packages delivered to wrong addresses. It's absolutely unacceptable when I pay for guaranteed delivery"
1,"My preferred payment method is Zip. Was previously able to select this in the app. Suddenly, no Zip! Logged into the website and Zip was available. Until This glitch is fixed the app is only useful for searches, which I might as well do through the website since I can't checkout in the app any more."
1,"One star for the delivery chaos! It's getting worse and makes no sense that Amazon Day delivery can't apply to all items and some items insist on arriving in one day when it's not convenient or the other stuff isn't ready. Fastest Delivery, Prime Delivery, Priority Delivery, Amazon Day Delivery all on one order! It's so disorganised and inefficient and such a waste of time and fuel. Now there's a by 1pm delivery too which splits the order up! I thought Amazon was supposed to be convenient?!?!"
1,I do not recommend Amazon for international shipping. If the product is defective you have to pay all the fees to return the items (shipping and import fees back to USA). The only thing that I'm glad is that I manage to close the account to force myself to not use Amazon anymore
1,"Started showing unskippable full screen ad of Lord of The Rings Usually the app is ok, but recently it started continuously showing a full screen unskippable ad. That type of behavior is more suitable for low grade rubbish sites, not a service that you pay for."
1,"Horrible, I always had issues with the delivery and nobody helped. The app is horrible too. Will never buy again. Do not buy prime! They trick you into thinking you have priority when you wait the same time for the items like a regular delivery. Customer servive is useless"
1,"Get rid of the automatically playing, full screen ring of power ad. It's the shopping app, keep your video and movie stuff separated. Full screen , non excitable for several seconds is absolutely rediculous."
3,Mostly pretty good. But the past couple times I ordered something it never showed up and I was never able to get my money back either. I still like shopping on Amazon but I don't like when I pay for something and then never get my item it seems to be happening a lot.
1,"I'm absolutely disappointed with this app. I can't find the things that I want AND it constantly gives me the message ""having trouble with Amazon server"". It loads much much slower compared to the previous app. Please fix this."
1,I downloaded the app because I need notifications on delivery so I can rescue my package before it gets stolen. But the app is really bad at sending delivery notifications. I get one maybe once in a while. Please fix this essential feature.
1,"Edit 10/13/79: Again why change? Now I cant find my orders. So irritating....Why did you change? The previous version was so much easier to navigate, this one is clunky and instead of an easy transition it turned it all upside down. Terrible."
1,What a god awful experience using this app and trying to pickup from a drop box. WOW! I honestly think this killed Amazon for me. Such a painful and long process. Yeah I'm done ready for whatever Amazon 2.0 is because this is horrible. There is not enough space here to express how long and painful using this app. Honestly could have gotten everything done I needed to EASIER is I wrote Letters to the sellers. Just wow. Who ever is in charge of this app and it's development needs to fired.
2,Why is the buy now button gone?! It's a little ridiculous I have to add everything to my cart and then purchase from there. There's several reasons to purchase items individually without having to go through the cart. It's aggravating at the least.
1,"They suck hate their new payment process! They don't take their money until it shipsso stupid. When I place the order I want the funds removed at time of order not when it ships. My bank I must pre-authorize an exact amount prior to the transaction being processed, so then it won't process later and my order cancels everytime. It should be an instant transaction not delayed in any way or split transaction amounts based on shipments its so dumb. Going back to eBay."
1,"The new upgrade has the app absolutely HORRIBLE now, can barely use it because it crashes CONSTANTLY or just won't load anything!!! I am beyond disappointed and frustrated because I can no longer find anything because the app it absolute garbage now... I used Amazon constantly and now I can't use it at all..."
1,"They moved from 2-day delivery to four day delivery without notifying anybody, if this M.O. keeps up, I'm canceling my prime membership! If they keep increasing the price of prime membership and cutting back on delivery times, that kind of negates the whole point of the prime membership, in the entire reason most people not only shop with Amazon but have been reliable repeat customers, after all with all all of Amazon's customers Amazon would be nothing."
5,"Always had a great experience. Makes shopping at all hours comfortable . However for some reason around 3-4 am their website takes a break and probably re-boots everything, including sale items. Worth the wait."
5,"Practical app and i always use it. Since the last update or so with the shortcuts..where did the wishlists shortcut go!? 😕 cannot find my lists, so started using the website; not as practical anymore. ..Update, shortcuts are back/fixed!!"
2,"On multiple occasions, I scoured the products to look for particular ""same day delivery"" with my Prime membership that they boast so much, because I needed the item urgently, I was given the estimated delivery time of ""same day"" e.g. 1pm or 7pm, and I'd set aside all day to wait for it. But then the item doesn't show and there are no updates until the estimated delivery time has passed, then the ""tracking"" updates with the next ETA of 2 to 4 days. May as well buy from ebay on 2nd class post."
1,"Amazon has just turned into a straight up scam. I ordered an espresso machine. Was charged for it. Order just DISAPPEARED. Doesn't even show up on my order page. Like it never happened. ""Customer service"" is, of course, completely useless. This used to be a real marketplace. Now it is just a scam!!"
1,"Ever since the recent update the app has been EXTREMELY SLOW. Slow when opening, slow when searching, slow pulling up information like account, orders, etc. Its been really frustrating considering the app used to be just fine before but now I rarely shop using the app, only on a desktop using the actual website..."
1,Layout is still horrible. Everything is spread out in unconvenient locations. Forced ads are getting worse causing the app the take longer just to open. Video app shouldnt be integrated with shopping app. Need to get rid alexa button always on the way. Dont need wont ever use it.
3,So its a somewhat good shopping app. But there are few other apps that has the same products for way cheaper. The only problem that I would add in this is... Receiving defective products that you have to pay way more then what you spent on it.... They need to make every Amazon store take all merchandise back instead of sending use to so many different locations!!!!!
3,"Should be way easier to use and the pictures don't come up, it just shows a blank square for everything. Crashes a lot. Registries could be easier to navigate."
1,"Amazon purchases never take less than 24 hours to go through. I am severely inconvenienced by this. Anytime I purchase something from Amazon, I expect it to be paid for and shipped within a reasonable time. It charges me 48 hours after I order things and then gets denied because I thought I had the money to spend. Amazon is sucking hard."
1,"awful Lord of the Rings advert Suddenly, today, every time I run this app there's a modal (no choice) video advert for Lord of the Rings. NO Amazon, this is an app for me to buy things from you. I do NOT want you inflicting an advert I cannot avoid before I can use your app. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs a new job."
1,Does nothing about fake products! I started shopping with Amazon thinking yes it's more expensive but as it comes from their warehouse it has to be legit. How wrong could I be. You will find fake products with multiple reports saying the product is fake and amazon does nothing. Even worse I have received emails promoting products that are fake. So Amazon seems happy to promote con artist!
2,"You'd think a company as large as Amazon would put a bit of effort into their mobile app. It is the slowest, jankiest app I have on my phone. Any time I am on another app and accidentally click on an Amazon ad, I cringe as the app slowly takes over my screen and struggles to load."
1,I've suddenly started to receive notifications in Spanish. I never changed any settings it just randomly started happening and there's no way to turn it off.
4,"I love amazon like everyone else but please update or fix the ""Review past purchases"" feature. Been suggested to rate some of the same products and services for like a year now!!! No matter how many times I've rated it, the System doesn't seem to register.. ."
3,For years the app has been freezing in the list section whenever I click on an item and try to delete it. I have to press the delete button many items in different areas for it to finally register. The list view is extremely laggy. It would benefit from swipe to delete function.
5,"I changed my review because I just didn't give this app a chance by then, but now I'm really happy with amazon as fast delivery professional team quick problems solving, reasonable prices, orders follow-up. I can find anything I think off like come on, and literally having your back no matter what. Thank you"
1,Amazon is horrible they dont guarantee shipping so my parcel has gone from between 3 and 5 days to between 3 and 15 days and they gave me a fake tracking number so decided to cancel my order and now its 3 days to do that....this company has turned into zero quality zero gurantee zero value zero responsibilty the only thing they sell of value is the same price as in store ...i have no faith in amazon on any level anymore i wont be using it and i definitely reccomend you dont use it. THEYRE FIRED!
1,"Dodgy corrupt company.. clicked on banner to sign up to a years worth of prime at 79 the day before the price rise. Did not realize, but on the next page I agreed on had changed it to the monthly option and now I have no chance to go back to the cheaper annual price. Have cancelled prime and with free deliveries to a locker and Netflix !"
1,"I hate Amazon. Do better both in appand as a company. In app when absolutely have to go through Amazon to get something, everything runs slow and is a constant add to buy something's else. I get it. You want me to buy more but I just want to buy one thing and be done."
2,"What's the point of a shopping app that doesn't let you buy? It's bad enough I can't buy books directly from the Kindle app any more, but now I can't buy them from the Amazon app either. No, I have to open Amazon in my browser to buy a Kindle book. Ridiculous."
1,I don't know what the hell you guys did - I have been a customer since 2007. App always was fine. Now there's no way to switch from my business account to my personal account. For some reason your app also suddenly decided that I have never ordered anything with you before in history for either personal or business. Works fine on desktop. App is now broken.
1,Stop showing full screen adverts when the app starts. When I tap to dismiss the prime sale ad you show now the tap gets passed through to whatever is behind it. It's like you are trying to make it harder for people to search and buy stuff.
1,"LITERAL GARBAGE! Never sends a single otp to my number despite it being required to log back in or make a new account, not only that, I can't access my old accounts because for whatever reason, I have to verify it with an old number I don't have anymore, smh. I also checked to see if that old account had any numbers linked and there was none, so why is it asking for the code from an old number."
4,"Great app and good service. I can understand that the new Lord of the rings series is a big deal, but can you please keep it to the prime video app and not on this one. Everytime app is open the ad pops up and its annoying"
1,"Well, after this, you deserve less than 1 star, amazon. I was looking for several laptops for sale on amazon i had them in my private list and shopping cart, in order to decide which one to choose. After probably less then a couple of days, every single laptop in my list/cart, went from 800/900€ to 950/1000+€. For absolutely no reasons i guess?.. Careful, I even checked a turntable i was looking for. same story. After this i've finally decided to close my prime account."
1,"Amazon had became horrible 1) disabled my ability to review and sent questions to seller 2) unable to fulfill promised 2 days even same days orders and all CS basically said nothing they can do. What was the prime benefit then? 3) shcarging back returns like 2 months after. Luckily i have a habit of monitoring my credit card bill. I got an email said I never return but when I msg them, they said it was a mistake and will withdraw the charge."
1,"I bought amazon prime. made 2 orders. Amazon charged my credit card for my order. after that, my account was blocked. I have neither money nor an order, my account has been blocked and none of the support can help.  This is the worst customer service in the world.  I feel like I was scammed and my money was stolen."
1,"Absolute rubbish app, can't accurately track purchases, constantly freezes. Not fit for purpose. There is an old adage, if it ain't broke don't try and fix it!!!"
3,"I use the app a lot and the adverts when it's opened are so annoying. I'm going buy something I want, not what you think I should buy. I've started to buy from eBay more as most resellers are on both platforms."
1,"The new layout is really unfriendly. Now shows multiple items per line with no descriptions. Order page shows only when it is arriving without clicking, you have to click to see prices, etc."
2,"Stop playing with us! Each time, you update the app, you move around different menu items. For instance, ""Your Orders"" used to be on the front page. Then, you moved it under the three line icon. Now, it is under the person/account icon. Please learn some consumer psychology and stop playing game with us. You might think you are being clever. We think you are being annoying."
1,"The app has a psyche intrusion hack access onto my account. It was programmed to interrupt my time using pictures of dogs and the app maintains a persistent false error alert status, It is a complete mental rash that can be unobstructedly caused onto private cell phone users. And Amazon support's response through Google play was that the developers will have a chance to view my comment for the chance of a consideration."
5,It's finna be a riot. like if this game really doesn't pay..! Because I'm already addicted to it I like it it's shiny like I said I've been hitting mini and grand prize slots and I'm already up to $500 and I have yet to cash out figured I'd play all the free coins and see my outcome will review at a later date once I actually have cashed out to let you know if it really is or isn't the crazy hype it's supposed to be.
1,"They sold me a computer with missing Operating system and SSD drive. Then wanted me to pay to return the computer to them. Amazon does not check to make sure the items they sell actually work. They just sell items without testing to see if they work or not. Just want money. After being threatened to remove my account I decided to just have my account removed. I didnt remove this review because it is true, i was sold a device with missing parts. Uninstalled Amazon permanently."
1,"I ordered and i waited for 2 days for the item to be delivered. But then suddenly, it shows that the address I have provided was incorrect. I ORDERED BEFORE and DELIVERED with the same address. There is no any live chat that you can speak to. I cancelled it now and I will never order again. Very bad service."
2,"Please allow me to disable the live videos. They come up too easily web you're scrolling, like a trap. The problem is that I don't trust using the Amazon app during work hours anymore because the videos often come up too loud. So please, let me disable the live videos!"
5,"It's very nice having easy access to items that are affordable, good quality, and delivered so fast. It is truely such an amazing experience, I am very thankful, and appreciate every single person's hard work that makes it possible. I also really like the considerate return policy, THANK YOU, Amazon!! Also, I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all the Amazon employees & associates. The drivers, sorters, programmers, management, Jeff Bezos, and every other department. Stay Awesome!"
5,Watch out for Chinese counterfeit items. If you see something priced way too low it's a fake! But when there are real items the app is very useful and intuitive
1,"Experience gets worse and worse. What am I paying for? 2-day shipping is non-existent, their process times are upwards of 4-5 days. The prices aren't competitive, and their rando vendors are getting worse and worse. Walmart, Lowe's, and others are picking up their slack with significantly better delivery and process times, free shipping isn't always true, but, it is on many alternate sites. They have basically done a bait and switch, we have become to habituated to Amazon and it's ""ease"" it's bs"
1,This company has no idea how to handle pre-orders. I pre-ordered an item and today is the release date. I went to check the status and it says will ship in 2-3 weeks. I called customer assistance and they said it's because the location nearest me doesn't have any. The point of a pre-order is so that you can have the item at the nearest distributor on release date. And after the latest update I can't even use the app on my tablet.
1,"This app is for browsing, not shopping. Unusable if you already have an idea of what you need. There are very limited search filters based on amazons recommendations for what they think you should get and you can't filter by price or pull up the warehouse or outlet deals. Plus, it's painfully slow. The experience this app provides is similar to being 13 and promised Panda Express, but it was a trap and now your stuck underwear shopping with your mom."
1,In the beginning it was great. My beef primarily is with the shipping. I'm paying a year subscription without the benefits. What happens to 2 day shipping. Now it 5 days. Fine myself looking a Walmart more often get my stuff sooner at least. Amazon you need to tighten up.
2,"I usually love using this app, the policies are great, delivery times are always fast and prices usually very fair. However, recently and for the past 2 weeks or so, I can't use the app. It keeps telling me ""oops something went wrong"" and im not able to search anything, find recommendations, or even look at my order history. Please help!"
1,Absolutely despicable customer service I reached out because over a week ago an item I return was received by the company and yet there is no refund being processed when I reached out to customer service told me that I'm just going to have to wait up to 30 days for my refrund because they didn't process the item With no reason why the item was not processed. The customer service representative was very rude would a big ship on her shoulder. The rudenes I dealt with today was acceptable. Delete
1,"If I open up my Amazon app again, and have to sit through an advertisement before I look at whatever I need to look at, I'm going to cancel my Prime Membership immediately. I hope everyone else will join me on this. Having to sit through ads for Lord of the Rings garbage when I pay an exorbitant Prime membership fee is ridiculous"
1,"Recently got an email saying Amazon had noticed ""unusual activity"" on my account after I added my card details so they locked it. Then asked for verification through billing statements which I provided, each time being denied, leading to my account being permanently closed this morning. Yesterday I called their customer service twice to get some sort of dialogue going and theyve apparently ignored this as I provided proof it was me then too! Dont trust them with your money, already lost mine."
1,If I could give no stars I really would! Amazon customer service is the worst! I'm having an issue getting a refund. All the customer service reps are not trained the same. They want a bank I no longer use to issues a check on behalf of Amazon. These reps don't talk English good. They don't understand I don't have that account it's closed. It's close to a $400 refund that Amazon doesn't want to give me back only just give the run around. Amazon needs to fix this asap!
2,"I like the app but the forced translation makes the experience very unpleasant. I live in France, Amazon french account but I only use English phone and apps but somehow Amazon forces on me french translations so products name are literally translated word for word and that makes every single product name and description very useless. I wish we could have an option not to translate products description so we can search in any language."
1,"UPDATE: This POS app gets worse with every update. Now they hide your order history at the bottom corner of a screen that you can't find without going through all of their other ways to take your money first. Profits over people just like everything else. I have it set to NOT show my browsing history on the ""Manage History on this Device"" page but it STILL SHOWS MY HISTORY ANYWAY!!! THANKS FOR TELLING MY WIFE WHAT HER BIRTHDAY PRESENT WILL BE, IDIOTS!!!"
4,I'm going start off by saying ADD A DARK MODE OPTION!!!!!! The app works great for the most part. It doesn't crash on me and I can do everything I want to do on it which is buy products. I'm just tired of the very bright white background. I omitted a star because it's killing my eyes. Please fix this
1,"No dark mode setting. App runs very slow and glitchy, crashing whenever it opens after last update. All filter menus are buggy and keep flashing."
2,"Finding stuff is getting harder and harder, filters being removed and replaced with suggestions is about the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Your algorithms aren't that good to begin with. Making me scroll through 100s of unrelated things isn't going to make me want to buy them, it's going to make me uninstall the app."
3,"App keeps crashing! Whenever I want to change the currency the app crashes, and takes a long time to open again, as pressing the icon doesnt do anything. Once open the currency still wouldnt be changed..."
5,"I've been ordering from Amazon for about a year or so now, it's one of my favorite apps, because they have so many different varieties of products, and I've never had any trouble with receiving my orders. Plus, they are always on time, or early! Yep, I love Amazon shopping!!"
1,"Does not work. Filter for delivering to my country is broken. Last month the app was not able to run at all. Amazon is good for USA only, everywhere else it is sub par. Also note real Amazon is only in USA, all others are inferior clones."
5,"This app is amazing, once someone tried to get into my account and they were on it right away. I buy all my stuff there, I am always happy with my products and I also get the prime membership. It's a very good subscription. I would tell everyone to shop Amazon"
1,"Filter doesn't work. Select free shipping and yet many of the results have shipping fees?! Search returns completely irrelevant items. Displaying out of stock even though the option isn't selected. Displays a price, click on the item and it's more expensive. Apply a sort based on price and the number of returned results greatly reduces?! I like Amazon, especially during the pandemic, but this app is very poor. Doesn't work over VPN! Can't copy a link to share with others."
1,"Multi-page advertisements abound. The app is now loaded with multipage advertisements for paid features, it interrupts the shopping.. which makes very little sense considering they make money from my shopping. going to avoid"
3,"The app does not have features built in for accessibility. It relies on your phone or other apps to do that. This is a violation of the ADA. Using other apps to shpp is not always a smooth, easily experience. And it violates the law."
1,"Won't let me log in. I had to uninstall the app because it wouldn't let me purchase, look in my cart, or go to home page. Just re-download the app and now it won't let me log into it. It sends me the verification texts and once I click the link it says ""approved"" but app won't let me log in!! Uninstalled AGAIN!!! ETA now the app won't let me see my saved lists or the items I had in my cart. It'll show everything on their website, but not on the app. Uninstalling yet again.."
3,"Every other (always the first time) I open the app. It won't pass the ""you can't join prime on the app"" page, so I always have to reopen it. Also, unless the internet is perfect. It takes forever to load. The filters are too simple and too few. You can't choose your own price range, only something like £1-£25, £25-£50 (but not both (why?)). Also, changing the order will not work (or I'm too impatient to wait) unless signal is perfect. Edit:You can now swipe/click back button to bypass problem."
2,"The Amazon App has suddenly stopped showing all previous orders and none of my wish lists show. I can see all this if I go through a web browser so I know it's not my account, it's an App problem. This happened suddenly whilst the app was open and I was doing a search. After looking around the App it turns out that my location had been switched to the USA even though I hadn't done that. Once I switched my country back to the UK, everything came back. Talk about a glitch."
1,"Last year with prime. Amazon increased the yearly prime cost and 9 outta 10 items we order take a week or more to get. The whole point of prime was 2 day shipping. If the price doesn't drop or 2 day shipping becomes common again, I'm out at the end of this year. Not worth paying $140 per year for standard shipping non prime members already get."
1,"Order a few sizes up, 3XL are barely large. Several items arrive and are completely different material or appearance as items ordered. Good luck always check the reviews and questions before ordering. Happy Holidays."
3,"This is a big issue, for when you want to leave positive feedbacks. Every time I leave a positive feedback it doesnt go through or something I get an message at the end that it will take a cuple days for it to process but it doesnt cause when I check if it went through it ask me again if I want to leavce a feedback. And to me this is a big issue cause my positive feebbacks dont go through."
1,"Wish the quick links under the hamburger menu didn't become about the upsell, but instead persisted customer focused prompts, like orders or where's my stuff. It used to be. Sad to see it change. (10/09/22)"
1,I signed up for the prime trial because I wanted the benefit of getting my items within 2 days that is not the case everything seems to be 3 to 10 days out I called the customer care service and they explain to me that if they're fulfillment center does not have that item it will take longer for shipping everything in my cart that was ordered is taking longer than 2 days and the representative told me there is no point in having Amazon prime because everything will be later than 2 days. WOW!
3,"Okay that's real smart yeah let's take the ability to purchase songs from the music app out of the music app and put it into our shopping app then let's make it to where you can't even buy songs in the shopping app if you're on a phone... You guys are a trillion dollar company and you're making the most moronic, idiotic, and anti-consumer-friendly updates to your apps like what what what's happening here... Like seriously a company with a net worth of $1,000 wouldn't make these mistakes"
1,"So I have tried to order my aniversary gift on Amazon twice. The first order got canceled for no known reason. So I immediately tried to order the items again. This time I made sure to confirm the delivery date. Today's the day and BAM nothing. So I call Amazon after realizing the order got mysteriously canceled again! My anniversary is in two days and now I have no gift. All Amazon offered - after admitting the fault was a glitch on their end - was free shipping, no offer of express delivery."
1,"I've been with amazon since 2008 and I have always enjoyed shopping and using Amazon, I trusted Amazon, fast forward 2022. It's been a total nightmare, app said it delivered my packages 4 times within 3 months and clearly it didn't arrive,plus package being stolen because driver with no common sense left it in plain view might as well have place my package in the middle of the street... redundant customer service, oh by way,help is overseas heavy thick accent, Can't understand them."
5,"Always top notch customer service! Always very fast & efficient deliveries. I love how Amazon takes a picture where the delivery has been placed at the home/delivery location. Usps, FedEx, and ups should take note...."
1,"Horrible service! I used the app to start a return. I received the QR code and after returning the item, contacted customer service through the app to confirm the return. The agent canceled my return and screwed up my refund! What should have only taken 2-4 hours to refund, will now take 14 days!!! I contacted customer service through the app again, the agent I spoke with was rude and basically said they screwed up and deal with it. Amazon service has gotten so bad, not worth shopping anymore!"
1,"I recently ordered items from amazon and I changed my mind at the last minute and decided to cancel some. But now I'm getting notified saying that amazon put my account on hold due to some ""unusual billing"" or something like that. I don't know what I did wrong for this to happen but I already but my information in the billing form but it keeps declining. HELP!!"
5,Aside from search engine not being very consistent. And the absolute need for search filters in order to get just a few in list to be what you're actually looking for. Best thing ever
1,There is NO WAY to get in touch with someone at Amazon to say that an order which shows as delivered has not been delivered. It goes around in circles. You can only query the database and it keeps doing the same results from the database i e delivered
3,"There are menus that have overlapping content, and overall the UX is all over the place. The is also the one app I have that STILL doesn't have a findable dark mode."
4,Good app I use it to shop for so many things however don't need to show me sponsored crud. I'm already here to spend money on your site there's no need for advertising. Absolutely 0. I'd also like 2 day shipping returned. Covid is mostly in the past and I pay good money for prime. Most deliveries take way longer than 2 days with prime. Also I would use Amazon Smile for charity but the app forces marketing notifications turned on first. I feel Amazon Smile is a marketing gimmick.
4,"I live in The Netherlands but I'm not Dutch and I can't change the app language to English because it's not one of the languages available. It's very annoying, please fix this problem. I pay the Prime also from ages. Thanks Edit: English language implemented"
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would. First of all I'd like to to mention that I posted a review about them. But it was in the app. So it says any reviews go towards the 3rd party seller. So here I am. I bought a pair of shoes. Must have been a scam. On the app it said delivered. I never got the package. I requested the seller contact me. Never got a response. I requested a refund. Still haven't got the refund. Terrible customer service. Terrible business. They have scammed me out of $160.88."
1,Had this app for god knows how long. But recently it's been playing up. At first I thought it was because there was an update that needed to be done. Nope not that. First I was getting the home screen but nothing loading. So thought okay maybe I need to clear the cache. Did that no change. So thought maybe I need to uninstall and reinstall. Nope. Restart my phone?. Nope. Won't even open now. I don't know what else to do my end. Think I've done everything. So must be a developer issue right? Idk
1,Customer service is horrible. Didn't get a package. All I wanted was for my account to get credited so that I can purchase the item again and they kept on telling me wait 48hrs. Called again and told me to wait another 48hrs. Item was labeled missing and they expected me to wait another 48hrs so that I can get refunded. Even tho I told them I just want to get credited. Amazon gets 1 star.
1,Ordered a packaged and it said delivered to residence mailbox went to check the mail and it was not there. Amazon has a policy that if you do not receive the item on time you qualify for a full refund and the item is free but when you call customer service they try to play it off as the buyers fault and they do not follow there policy at all. Would not recommend anyone using this app unless you want to get ripped off and have piss poor customer service
1,"They are getting more and more aggressive and intrusive with this app. You think this is a shopping app? Not anymore. The moment you open it, they force you to watch an ad clip of their new LOTR movie or whatever it is. They're getting bold, and can't imagine what else they're doing with it."
1,"Menu system is very poor. App is slow and clunky. Notifications and tracking doesn't work properly anymore. Slow to load, even on my top of the range Android device"
2,I've used Amazon for years but as of about the last 2 years its just bad. I always get money taken out for Amazon prime even tho I never get it. I've had yo get a new card 3-5 times because Amazon wouldn't stop. The only reason I I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I can't really find anywhere else to buy the stuff I get on here. If I could find some other app than I would just stop using Amazon.
1,"This app has been noticeably more buggy and slow for the last two weeks. No idea why. Edit: Another update, WTAF has happened to my past purchases, orders and lists?!!? All gone, even what I had saved for later and my cart!!! I'd give zero stars if I could!!!"
3,"Was working fine until a few months ago. It started to show a page where I have to check my internet and thus show a dog saying ""uh oh"". Everything was fine till this pop-up appeared on my phone. No matter what I do it just blocks me from buying anything."
3,"The app is ok... I really wish that either...1) a share option was available in app, or 2) I could access Amazon through my browser... So that sharing can be utilized. Honestly so stupid that both off those things are not possible... But at least one would be a huge improvement"
1,"In no way whatsoever do I recommend Amazon. I'll be doing my best to garner as much attention on social media as possible in this matter, but they rip you off constantly. You pay an indeterminable monthly fee due to them repeatedly charging for membership. Then most your orders get delayed. There's supposed to be rewards accrued over time when ordering no rush delivery but it doesn't occur. They don't care about employees or customers because they're so massive and owner is filthy rich."
1,"I Accidentally deleted a saved order of several items. Okay, there's has to be a easy way to find them. Perhaps the one star is just because I'm stupid. With my continual orders, this is my first one star. I'm very frustrated. I want to call you you, ask for help. This suck!!"
1,"You guys absolutely ruined the delivery/ shipping look. Now nothing is in order, everything is arbitrarily put wherever, some items are above the delivered items, some delivered items are above the shipping items, like. Please fix this, it looks so awful now."
2,I live in Mexico and have two addresses. One in the United States and one in mexico. So I download the Mexico Amazon app so I can track my packages to my delivery here in Mexico and the damn thing automatically switches me to United States Amazon app and I can't track my Mexico purchases at all. Effing sucks. Uninstalling this right now.
1,Customer experience is horrible. I've had about 5 items ordered that have never shown up and the only way to get a refund is to return the item. But if there is no item to return you do not get reimbursed.
1,"Made it extremely difficult to request refunds, I spent approx 300$ and nothing arrived, Correct address, neighbors didn't get it, Just nothing, and I've only managed to get TWELVE dollars back, It's genuinely been my worst experience with online shopping, I'll never be using Amazon again unless this issue was somehow fixed"
1,"I have had nothing but problems getting anything delivered lately. One order stayed in there warehouse for several days and the app kept changing the delivery date so I had to cancel it. Now this order was a few stops away and they stopped the delivery. The customer service bot says it will be delivered at 8 P. M , the chat bot says tomorrow and the email link says Thursday. I think it's time to get rid of Amazon when my prime account is up for renewal."
2,"Not being a tech savvy person, I had a lot of difficulty placing my order with Amazon and then once the orders were delivered, I had an impossible time to post my objections to the delivery status, for instance it will a picture was shown that the package was at a door, but it wasn't our door, so I don't know where it was and I paid for something that did not get delivered. I also had ordered my delicious lindt chocolates and they were left on the porch in the Sun so they all melted--money lost!"
1,So out of nowhere for some reason I cannot purchase anything it only allows me to add to cart when I click on item it does not show me the option of buy now. Don't understand. And it is not my device because it's doing it on my daughters who lives in Florida I am in Philadelphia on both my cell phones and my computer as well. Tried contacting them and it was like talking to a two year old SMH
1,"The very 1st purchase I attempted to make was a time limited lightning sale from the prime early access deals and they denied my payment and locked my account for zero reasons it was a regular purchase and they tried to say it looked suspicious so even though it's the only purchase I ever made they locked my account then I had to call their terrible customer service line and wait for them to tell me my account will be locked for 24 hours meaning I'll miss all the sales, I'm canceling all amazon"
2,"I loved the app when it worked. Constantly crashes, says there's no internet connection when I'm clearly connected, takes forever to load and I have to close and reopen it 20 times to get what I want."
2,"Used to be great, back in the day. Unfortunately they stopped using UPS and instead insist on shipping your packages via the most unreliable and incompetent shipping agency around: the US Post Office. Good luck getting your order in one piece, assuming you even get it at all."
1,"Unusable. Automatically ""translates"" whatever I search for, the result is nonsense 100% of the time. You can then undo the translation, but now even this doesn't work anymore. Btw, it translates to german, even though my language is set to English."
1,"Useless customer service. I have had an account and ordered countless things over the years and now I no longer have access to my account. I tried signing in one day and apparently my account was locked. The only advice they could give was to call back and try again or make a new account. So, I'm just going to use ebay from now on unless I can get my account back with some proper customer support."
2,Love the app but lately it's been having a lot of crashes and errors that I can't even do my shopping. And I'm trying to fix my billing problems but I can't even go to my account to fix it.
1,"They just blocked my account and now can't unblock it and don't even want a reason to say why it can't be unblocked. I sent the documents they needed more than 5 times and each time they refused to be unblocked, why?! Update : I called to customers service more than 15 times and no one can help me, some of them said that they gave information about my account to specialist, but no one contact me... So I can't use amazon no more, 'cause they block all my new accounts with no reason... It sucks.."
2,"Searching through orders on Android results in infinate loop of app thinking, with progress loading and resetting over and over, never populating list of past orders. App has been like this for over a month. Very frustrating."
5,"Great choice and Services Simple and straightforward to use, helpful customer support if any issues occur Products can be weak and soft at times, but you have to trial and error to find what you need Once you find the product you need, it's easy to reorder"
1,Why is it that if you add an app to your fire tv it appears as a purchased item in your Amazon account it really isn't necessary... They were free to add... They should be removable or just not added to the list.
3,Ok after looking in my settings to make it go back what it use to be on Orders I found nothing. Now I can't see stuff haven't delivered which means I have to scroll around. Not Shipped option still there at least but I prefer Not Delivered option. Also this need select multiple options
3,The section on Your Orders has not worked in monthes. I always have to go to my computer to check on prior orders and deliveries. I expected it was a problem that would be fixed right away but it persist. Everything else is good.
5,"Always works, never any issues. I wish I could say this about many other apps. The complaint I do have is the site constantly asking me to install Alexis. If I wanted to use it don't you think I'd already have downloaded it ? I do not want that feature. Is there any way to disable that option ?"
1,"FIX YOUR APP. I've been having so many issues with this app. One of them is: I can't clear my search from the search bar. Everytime I try and clear it, when I go back, it comes back in the search bar and it's SO ANNOYING AND FRUSTRATING. ALSO, I'm getting CONSTANT CRASHES. This app is so broken. This app is from a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK PROPERLY."
1,"Please put I don't buy Chinese garbage in your algorithm. It's so annoying I have to Google specific part numbers to find what I'm looking for. When I enter brand and model the items don't show up, just a bunch of garbage that seller are paying to put there. It's worse evetime I use this trash app."
1,"This app uses way too much data always fails toad anything about your past orders or your profile""uh oh something went wrong"" they only want you looking at more new items to consum. About time something goes right Amazon."
1,"The app is horrible I can't access my orders or my account details cuz this mssg always pops up ""Uh-Oh something wrong happened on our side""!!! Prime videos became all in German and there's no even subtitles!! Even tho many languages were available earlier this year! I cancelled my prime and soon will deactivate my account!"
1,I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app and still get a error on my Samsung Tab A 10. It say something went wrong on there end when I click on orders. Started about 2 months ago and when I use a web browser I have no problems. 🤔🤔
1,"Canceling prime! Delivery is taking longer and longer lately! It'll tell you that you will get your item in a few days but then after you pay for it, within the next day or so it always changes! I bought something the other day and it said 2 day delivery, now I just checked and it's going to be here in the middle of next month! Walmart is Just as fast and you don't have to pay $100 a year!! Amazon is going down hill!!!"
1,"Latest patch made it horribly slow to load, and new menu interface is annoying and was reposition completely unnecessarily. 2 22 2022 update still very slow to load menus even after new uodates. 9 2022 now they force video advert at startup of application... last straw, closing account."
1,"Got a new phone and it won't let me enter my password to log in; when I enter my email it sends me a one time password by email, and when I enter it, it asks for my email again, and then OTP, and so on. No opportunity to enter my actual account password to log in. I have 2FA enabled on my account so all this BS is unnecessary. Called customer service and they hung up halfway through ""helping"" me. Called again and it's like someone butt-dialed me: I can hear people in the background, nothing else"
1,What the hell ?? We have 11 items on our subscription scheduled to be delivered on the 10th of each month. You should be charging us on the 8th. But no. You decide to start charging us on the 4th and deliver some of our items on the 10th and the rest of what we really need some other day. That's bad business.
1,deliveries never go on time. the 2-day delivery has gone out the door. they say they deliver till 10:00 when you work for a shift who stays up till 10:00 this company has gone down the hill and not the same as it used to be. I'm done with Amazon I don't recommend them anymore. and I've spent thousands of dollars on Amazon and I'm just going to go to a brick and mortar store.
1,"Ridiculous customer support. Three separate calls,no success gaining access to my account. I understand cyber security is a valuable asset as a company but security to the point a loyal customer gives you guys all the requested info and still isn't enough. I'd say that's an issue. Amazon if you see this please help me re attain access to my account."
1,Please provide the option to disable the Prime Video trailer preview/splash screen that runs when the shopping app is opened ...very annoying and completely unnecessary. This excessive marketing being pushed onto people is very invasive and unwanted.
1,"Browsing history keeps re-enabling itself. I turn off the browsing history when I notice it is on. Then after a few weeks to a month or so, browsing history would be on again. I never enabled it but it reenable itself."
2,"Lacking basic functionality like filtering for custom prize range. Interface for filtering and sorting confusing and frankly ugly. With so many different and very similar products, this functionality and its ux should be at the heart of the app."
3,"I love having the ability to shop on amazon using this app! However, the app has changed the language to Spanish twice in the last month. It's a bit frustrating."
2,"The products I buy from Amazon just becomes useless and unoperable in at least a few months to a year. I bought a 1TB flash drive, all files you rename becomes ""corrupted and unreadable"", I tried buying a shelf with a such amazing price and then got canceled with the dumbest excuse, I even wrote a review about the company but Amazon just insisted in declining the review unexcused, and I bought a floor lamp that only lasted for a few months. Go buy the REAL products from retail stores."
2,"Terrible app, none of the Amazon apps let me see my order history, I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app 3 times, cleared the data and cache's. All I keep getting is... Ooops, something went wrong on our end... Amazon needs to get their act together."
1,I would think that with the gobs of money this company makes they would make it easier on the customer. I'm in the app trying to find out what account my gift card was applied to. Just bouncing me all over the place. Mostly back to square one. Wasting precious moments of life.
2,"Used to be perfect, couldn't leave it alone. New filters are terrible, clunky to navigate and don't even work. Very frustrating!"
2,It seems broken as of 10/20/2022. I can't connect. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work. Back to the browser for me. I had been using it for years with OK results.
5,Much as I like Amazon but it's the app there's a certain time that it should be updated half the time it's like okay but the next other times it's kind of ghetto one you can't hardly ever track your orders when you want to or if you're trying to cancel an item somehow it's out of date something needs to be done here get it updated other than that I've always liked Amazon and another issue is when you request a refund when you go to Cancel an order they seem to be slow and not reliable?
3,"Every time I have ordered anything in the past 2 years, my payment card has been compromised. Just yesterday I ordered something I couldn't find elsewhere and this morning when checking my credit card, there is a pending charge from Amazon. After speaking with Muhammed (an excellent Amazon customer service rep) who clearly explained the charge, my opinion of Amazon has changed. Still not happy regarding returns ending up in landfills or with employee treatment as exposed by W5."
1,Deleting items in wish list is too time consuming.please fix!. Need a tick multiple item that are not needed anymore and then delete all at once instead of clicking on each item and deleting one by one.very annoying.... also a swipe left for single deleting items
1,"Lately when I go to view my orders its starts glitching and all I see is a blank white screen with the top of the app appearing and disappearing, sometimes even the app showes an error message says were having trouble displaying your order please fix this its so annoying."
1,False advertisement. Prime takes as much time as standard except you pay for prime. Overpriced products are shown the most over inexpensive and good quality ones. Hard to do returns.
1,"When you order something and pay extra to have it shipped faster, you should get the package for when you paid to have it delivered. If you don't have it delivered by then you shouldn't still have to pay the rediculous shipping price. I'm not paying for a service i didn't receive."
4,"As much as I hate to admit it I do love Amazon shopping -- every once in a while an update to this app breaks down, but for the most part it works well and the interface is (relatively) user-friendly."
2,"Amazon is fine. But I feel like there are a few things missing from the app for me to enjoy it more. When the ""recommended for me"" product is not something I want, I don't even know if I can let Amazon know that they got it wrong. And I, currently in my life, do not care about back to school. I don't use pencils everyday, I don't need a book bag. While they're cute, they're just not needed where I'm at. Edit to add: the layout of the platform is old."
2,"With the new UX, the tabs load extremely slow (~5s). Would be nice to have the options on the bottom nav bar as configurable since I prefer having orders in it instead of choosing it from the kabob - usability flaw."
1,Used to be able to only shop Amazon Recently got a purchase from China that I would have had to pay $22 to return. Now I'm seeing more items with $40 shipping to purchase. You have to really pay attention to each item you click on making it more work to purchase than necessary.
1,"They stole my money. I still haven't received my ps3 controller. They also locked my account so I can't even get help with it. Tried calling them only to be told ""we can't tell you why your account is locked nor can we unlock it. Do what the app says because we're a bunch of illegal immigrants"" except when I try to, it asks me to upload a document regarding my updated credit card info (info that hasn't expired yet) and....the link is dead. It doesn't let me do anything. Lawyer."
5,"The best shopping experience in my life. The customer support and the team of this amazing platform is purely legendary for its kindness and understanding. These guys will always solve their users problems no matter what. The best proof of being a human is right here in this platform. I recommend using it from the bottom of my heart. Amazon was, is and will always be one of the best shopping experience. Thank you guys !"
1,Amazon use to be a great app. But every other time i try to order something I have to change the language back to english. Its a pan in the bum to have to constantly change it.
1,"Amazon!!!!!!A great app, concept, and world of possibilities!! Amazon can be your browser, voice(Alexa), grocery shopper, entertainment, AND bank . The trust required to depend on Amazon merrits agents capable of handling costumer requests not thrust unarmed to the front lines against costumer dissatisfaction. You can't remove a phone number I no longer access? I sent you the screenshots of my account , phone# but different person and address!!! You still can't change it? Ok."
5,"Works Well, easy to use, like to swipe to pay button, very good alternatives shown. Recommended sizes are incorrect (I now get the next size up from those recommended). Used on Samsung 8+ and 9."
1,"What is going on with your app?? I can only access front page and basket .. I've even updated the app.. extremely annoying when I'm trying to follow my expected but late delivery so I'm ""talking"" to the seller ..guess what, I can no long continue that particular conversation.. needs sorting out ASAP!!!.. so at this moment only 1 star.. before October update I didn't have any problems."
1,Search is trash. If you want something specific don't bother it will just show you popular items somewhat connected to what you're after. Today I was searching something of a specific length I needed. And the search just kept churning out unhelpful lengths which were unusable for me
5,The best thing about Amazon is if they don't have the best prices you can always get a good idea what the general price range is for what you are shopping for. They are also consistant with their Prime deliveries.
4,The only problem I've had recently that I hope gets fixed is being able to save items to your wish list. It won't let me like a item to put on my list so I can buy later.
3,"This pertains to the Amazon Fresh part of the app. I have no idea why their UX is so awful. Here's what I expected: 1. Open Amazon app, 2. Tap hamburger menu, 3. Tap Amazon Fresh logo, 4. Tap option to get in-store code. That's already pretty bad, as the code should be available at step #3. But the actual process is to select in-store from the Fresh section of the app, and the notice the bottom nav has changed and there's now an in-store code option."
2,"Slow, laggy. I'm not playing a game only browsing, so why does it take so long to get to a screen? Such as orders.. games perform better than this app that only needs to display stuff."
1,"My Amazon acct constantly converts back to Spanish from English. Everytime I go to look at something, order something or get my receipt I have to re-download the app. I have tried to use what they told me to do to get it back to English but that doesn't work. Very disappointed with the app because I like to buy from them."
1,Easy to use. Great if all you want is cheap knockoff brands and low quality items made in china. Look long enough and you might be lucky enough to find a legit product.
2,"The app is not great. When you click on ""subscribe and save"" it doesnt show you the products that you have subscribed to save, it just advertises products. Also there is no option to contact a seller after buying or returning an item. You can review a seller but not contact them. Also constant emails are very annoying. Every thing I order equals a new email I have to receive. There should be an option to turn off emails for orders and shipping information. This needs updating"
1,"Company supports sellers who scam, no way to report an obvious attempt at a scam unless you also sell with Amazon. Contacted a member of the support team and apparently without getting ANY information about the product I was talking about, they would fix the issue. 100% felt like I was getting brushed off. I am flabbergasted that a company of this magnitude and be designed so poorly. I HIGHLY SUGGEST not using Amazon, it is clear they do not give two flying ____'s about you."
5,Wonderful service as well as amazing bargains! Well worth the subscription cost that has various options depending on personal preferences! I swear by Amazon and all of their services. 👍
1,"I don't use Amazon nor ever wish to, however this app keeps installing by itself on my device. It feels like a major breach of privacy and consent, as I feel like it's trying to pressure me to use it. I have to keep uninstalling it."
1,The new upgrade is so much worse than the last upgrade. You can't even put low to high on pricing. Amazon you are making it so much harder to enjoy your app with each upgrade. If I could give no stars I would 🤬😡
1,I returned the item I purchased due to poor quality of the item. Got told 3 different ways to get refund. But still haven't received any of the 3 options. And now my account is locked due to unusual payment activity. I did nothing wrong and now I can't get an Amazon employee to tell me my refund status. This is not fair and I'm getting treated poorly.
1,Somehow this got worse since the last update. All of a sudden all my cards are declined even when they work perfectly fine everywhere else - especially with amazon UK! - and they tell me that the issue MUST be on my side! Seriously annoying and ignorant customer care!
1,"They sent me an empty package, so I downloaded the app hoping there'd be better customer service options, since theres no way to contact amazon on the website. The app was just as useless as the website."
1,"Filtering and sorting don't appear to work anymore. It's hard to tell if this is a real bug, or part of how they are replacing search with sponsored results and advertising. I'm not sure why I even bother with Amazon anymore. It's not convenient, prices are inflated, prime items are more expensive and often fake or broken, search doesn't work, delivery is unreliable and slow. Usually its easier, faster, and better service to order direct or find a local physical shop."
1,"Keeps displaying wrong items. Doesn't matter how much you search for specific products, Amazon mostly only display what they profit in the most. Example: ""M8 bolt 1.0pitch"" brings you results for all other sizes except ""1.0 pitch"""
1,"Several times I've ordered items from Amazon and have had the transaction show up on my Venmo, only to have them remove the transaction and immediately try to charge me a dollar or two more and my card not be able to cover it. If this continues, Bezos is losing another customer."
1,Seems that Amazon had decided to cripple purchasing functionality off the app by making it harder to navigate to wish lists and where has the saved for later items gone? Just found that it is worse. Searching for items is now bringing up completely inaccurate results.
3,Unable to contact a seller or customer service-only generic subjects. I want contact seller to ask about item as product is fine - but when Tried register for warranty it showes it was bought out of UK when labels say UK version. So I want only advice from seller as they can contact maker to report issue-and they can fix a problem or advice how to register it as bought in other country if that is case. Items work fine - I do jot want to return it etc-There is no option to simply ask question!!!
2,"It spams you with items you have no interest based on previous searches or things you bought. Example: you buy socks, now you have to scroll a couple pages of socks on the home page to find deal of teday. Why would you want to see that? Who would be interested in all those socks when you had bought them? Terrible programming and UX."
3,"Love this app, but I gave it 3 stars because I can't use it before bed. It desperately needs a dark mode. The screen is just too bright for nighttime viewing. When they add dark mode I will update my review to 5 stars."
1,"One star for forcing 2step verification on us. It's funny because you have a button where we can ""set up"" 2step verification, when in all actuality it's already set up and we can't turn it off. Nice try Amazon. I don't need you to babysit for me, or police for me. I'm a 51 year old man and can make my own decisions. Let the customers make decisions! Don't make them for us!!!!!!!"
4,"I have problems seeing items after I order them. Something about my Z Fold 4 screen's aspect ratio. Once that's fixed, I'll give 5 stars, because it's a well made app."
1,I used a card one time and didn't save it to my account. Well they saved it anyway and started using it for my audible account without my permission. I use this app to much to stop using it all together but it's definitely going to get used less atleast when I shop local they don't steal my card info and just spread it around without my consent.
1,"Can't access without multiple restarts. An advert shows (currently about prime). If you click to dismiss it does nothing, have to force quit multiple times for it to disappear"
1,"they tell you to order today to get your item(s) by _____ only to send out the items the day before,then they just keep saying sorry when you don't get it 5 days later. Amazon and the sm. Businesses are a joke! Not to mention, the price can and will go up before they ship it (happens often) THEY DONT HAVE 2 DAY SHIPPING ANYMORE. WHEN YO PACKAGE DONT COME THEY SAY JUST KEEP WAITING. IT MIGHT COME"
1,Please remove the ad from prime video from the start. It's not user friendly and I am not interested to see it every time I open the app. Besides the placement on the home screen is way intrusive.
3,"Rating Changed!! 1 star became 5 star (NOW 3 STAR!!). I always shop Amazon Smile for the charity donation. The app keeps ""pausing"" the smile setting in the app and being a real pain to get it to activate again. So, I'm just going to leave the rating at 3 stars until it stops being a pain to reactivate for at least a full year without issue. If you want your 5 star rating back stop breaking stuff that works every time you update your app."
1,Update 10/09/22 App started sorting orders as expected again but has now diverted back to sorting orders by the date ordered which makes having to take extra steps to find older orders which haven't shipped. It's even more frustrating when my wife's app sorts as expected and it's the same build and version.
3,"This is more for Google than Amazon, but the fact that I cannot purchase digital content in the app, is why I will after 17 years, I will begin transitioning off of Android. Feel free to share this with Google."
3,"Updated a couple weeks ago and now no links will open in the app. Not even from the notifications sent from the app itself. After all the strides y'all made to get Smile on the app, this major glitch is such a disappointment."
5,I love to order from Amazon!! The items always come pretty quickly easy to return when necessary. Huge selection of anything you need. Even free grocery deliveries for people who qualify low income.
3,Amazon has the best customer service but lately the prices have not been competitive with local stores. It was the opposite for years but now Amazon is more expensive. Seems like the company is going a different direction since the change in leadership.
1,"I'm finally giving this app 1 star. Why, for the past year, can't I view my recent purchases? Nothing happens, nothing shows. I have to go to the website in Chrome separately to see what I've purchased and what's the status, etc. I've kept the app up to date. 2023 this is bs! Samsung note ultra 20"
1,UPDATE: Since July 2022 I have reported this issue and it has consistently gotten worse. ORIGINAL: Has been crashing as soon as I open on my phone and TVs for 3 weeks. I've uninstalled reinstalled and haven't changed anything. Please address
2,"I love Amazon don't get me wrong but if it isn't one thing then it is definitely another, latest glich will show items that have already been delivered as being delivered or an item that is due today will show up as due tomorrow I spoke to them about a week ago the problem still hasn't been resolved. I needn't to go into explaining how this could cause problems for the customer and dilivery driver"
1,"Inexcusable customer service, so awful.. no chat bot.I cannot login , I need a loggin verification 2 step but my phone number has changed and I can't get anybody to talk to. Getting charged amazon prime for no reason. Sends me an email for my password but then needs a phone number.... why ,I just opened the number in email. Why even send the email. My bank has done the same thing and they are also a 1 star now from being absolutely great to barely functioning. Terrible service."
2,If you don't pay for prime membership then you will be ripped of on the postage. And speaking of postage that itself if a awful service. I've never actually had one delivery guy knock on my door. They always leave it on my door step or in the communal bin area. For this reason of postage rip of I'm moving back to ebay where postage is often free
1,Lists tabs are missing. Tool bar is gone. No drop down menu. Not as user friendly as it used to be. Crashes more often. No dark mode.
3,"I am an Amazon Prime member. I have two deliveries that are delayed 2-3 days. The customer service and commitment that Amazon Prime promises seems to be diminishing. Both delay are because of ""unforseen circumstances"" with no refund or compensation of the Prime next day deliver promise. This service and company is declining. Customer service is ""so sorry"" but not help."
2,"Can't see orders placed or shipping even when I get the message that an order is on the way! I go to the order screen and it just blinks! Fix it, this has been going on far too long and I'm quite sure you all know that it's a problem."
5,"As expected, Amazon's shopping app is top-notch! Seamless transitioning from browsing to finalizing your purchase, this app proves why Amazon is #1 in internet shopping. User-friendly, simple layout. Pleasure to use."
1,"Everytime I open the application with my galaxy note 10+ and I click on orders, it goes to open the page to show my purchased items and it give me a flashing white screen. I've deleted and reinstalled the application 2x and nothing is helping it."
1,It's been 4 days since i placed my order and still didn't receive it. I have called the customer care for following up today and got advised it will be delivered within few hrs but still not received. Being a prime customer and paying for the membership every month isn't value after all. I am cancelling the prime membership
2,I do not know what on EARTH they did with this last update. Everything is glitchy. Everytime I do anything in the wishlist area the app crashes and totally resets. Searching for items normally???? Crashes. What??? Why???? Please fix it!!
1,"Once Downloaded You Cannot Uninstall No Matter What You Do. It has locked into a German amazon and I cannot get back, to Canada. I could only uninstall Undates returns to ""factory version"". It was NOT in my phone when I bought it new and unlocked. Wtflip!"
5,"Amazon Shopping is the best way to do online shopping. There are a variety of items to choose from in every category. If you haven't tried it yet you are missing out on online ordering. Fast, easy and affordable delivery options as well. I don't order online any other way."
2,If I can't buy kindle books then the app is essentially useless!!!! I even went to the damn website and it tells me the title I wanted was not available for purchase but it has a price listed. Make up your minds!!!!!!
2,"I love almost everything about this App.What I don't like is the way YOU deliver items.Items came one by one? Let's say I ordered 20 diffirent kitchen items.. #Amazon I can WAIT a week or more for a ONE TIME delivery. More than two deliveries a day is tiring and ONE item worth 69 dhs I need to pay 89dhs for it. And the 22.95 worth item became 32dhs.""Additional"" charge per item? Seriously? What if I order 20 items? 20 deliveries? and I keep paying more ""per item?"" Seasonal buyer here."
1,Multiple times our package has said it arrived and never showed up. We never had a problem in the past but for some reason in the last month or so even though we are home it never shows up. I've even been outside when it supposedly arrived.
1,"It's false economy and fake convenience. I bought $700 worth of merchandise and had to return half of it because it was defective, cheap garbage. I think I get a refund but now I've helped fill the landfill, waste fuel, and waste my time bringing this junk back to FedEx so they can drive it back to the sweatshop."
1,"I started an account with my phone number not long ago and purchased a few things for my daughter, shortly after my account was temporarily locked due to so called suspicious activity and was asked for a billing statement. Which I provided multiple times and was even told that the information they want is what I was giving amazon, from the chime customer support service. And that account was closed because they kept denying my billing statements."
5,"A fantastic service! I love the ease and haste of the service. I also love the notifications and emails giving me updates every step of the way. People are crazy for hating this company, yet they still use it. It's great!"
1,Sells discarded/ broken products from specific manufacturers to people.. and when the customer attempts to post a review with photos of the product(s) Amazon will deny the request to submit a review!! Crazy they will allow a return though just to turn around and sell the stuff to somebody else who willingly gives money in good faith of getting an honest description amd or the actual product that isn't messed up and touched up..Anyway poor customer service when it comes to making others aware of
4,"Good app, but please stop saying an item is available for next day delivery (with prime) and after making the order it says it will be in 3 days only. We pay prime for next day delivery like it shows and sometimes even with prime items that doesn't happen."
1,First I ordered on Amazon but payment is declined. Then again after 26 hrs I placed new order for the same and it got successfully placed. Then after 26 hrs I received mail my previous order is successfully placed using backup payment plan without my notice and I didn't opt in for this method. Then I got partial refund and i called customer care for refund they're saying that we can't refund your full amount because of some service fee. They charged me fee which I didn't opt payment plan.
1,"This is the sixth time that your driver delivered to the wrong address. I always leave clear instructions on the app and they drove right pass me and left my package at an unoccupied building where it could have been stolen. It's like the drivers don't bother to read directions nor follow them. The Amazon app experience itself is fine, but the incompetent drivers ruin the experience of being a prime member in the first place. Quit hiring drivers who lie when and where they deliver their packages"
1,Amazon started giving worst service even prime members. Also most of the items getting cheap or useless. Shows the most items in US Dollars. When it comes to check out there is minimum 20$ shipping
1,One of the worse optimized apps from a major company such as Amazon. Extremely laggy and slow to respond to input. That combined with the practically zero quality control of the stuff people sell on Amazon makes me extremely close to stop being their customer. Update: No matter what I do I can't switch the app to English. It keeps reverting back to Spanish. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
1,Amazon prime free try before you buy is a joke! Free try can ONLY be used by credit cards and not debit cards. What's the point if I cant use my debit cards you idiots as I don't have a credit card or don't wanna use one. Why make it so retarded that I have to use a freaking credit card🤦‍♀️
1,"Member 10+ years. Quality is snowballing down hill. This year tgis app has been getting worse, flickering, closing, not loading. Least favoritw app currently. Get back to work Bezos ! Its falling apart fast. Upfated: absolite trash . has become impossible to shop."
1,"""Access popular pages quickly with our new shortcuts. Tap and hold the Amazon app icon to access your Orders, Daily Deals, Shopping Cart, and Search. AmazonSmile customers can now generate donations for their favorite charity. Just open Settings from the menu and tap AmazonSmile. Closet is a new feature in the Amazon App in the U.S. that helps you discover outfit ideas based on what you already own. Just open the menu in the Amazon App, go to Programs and Features, and tap Closet."""
2,"App is bugged even with prime and selecting refund for missing item IT WANTS OVER 8 DOLLARS FOR THE MAILMEN WHO DELIVERED AN EMPTY PACKAGE THAT STOLE TO PICK THAT ITEM UP FOR A RETURN! I'm not paying theives to pick up the packaging to my stuff they stole! 8 times this year I have received completely empty cut open packages through USPS! I shopped Amazon for years but this is SHAMEFUL TO CHARGE FOR A STOLEN ITEM SOLD BY YOUR STORE,NOT A THIRD PARTY ON IT!"
2,"Shortcuts is a headache. I have no idea how to change it. Before all I did was hit the 3 lines to click on orders. Now I have to hit the account button, then click on orders...how the heck do I add orders to my shortcut menu???? Which should have been there from the start obviously."
1,Waste of time and money. Also here's a money saving tip. better rip open the gift cards to make sure they have all the required digits to actually get the money to go through. Other wise it's not the stores problem or Amazon's. It's just money in to the God damn void.
1,I can't download the app and I never uninstalled it. I'm an avid shopper with Amazon. Had the app one day then the next it was gone and I can't download it back. I have more than enough memory on my phone. Please fix this problem.
3,"The latest update in Sept. 2022 broke the cart. I'll add something to my cart and then when I select my cart it says I have nothing there, yet the cart icon shows how many items I've added. I have to either use the ""Buy It Now"" option for each item or log into the full website."
2,Order page keeps auto refreshing almost every time I go to the page. So I can't search for items I ordered as a result. I end up having to use the web version if I need to search.
1,They sure have a lot of things but they sure suck getting your things to you tracking information for packages is never up to date if you live in a bad neighborhood I wouldn't recommend it I've had a driver leave a package on the sidewalk because I couldn't get it over to gate and it was stolen the biggest thing you'll get from this company is a loss of time that you'll never get back waiting on packages refunds customer service things like that I think I'll go back to wish deliveries just the s
1,"Don't fall for their prime trap, they can't deliver item on time and they ask you to wait more after the delivery date and customer service is overseas with no control over shipment. you will just wait. I waited more than 14days for prime shipping and yet they couldn't deliver. use alternative plus."
1,Amazon will take money out of your account for items you returned. They will rip you off. Don't order off here! They took money out four different time and they don't want to give it back! YOU SUCK BALLS AMAZON!!!!!
2,Every day I have more and more issues with Amazon. From packages not arriving to literally being charged a prime membership that I don't have and being told repeatedly I will no longer be charged for it. I'm sick of them taking my money and nothing is being done about it. I might stop using Amazon all together soon
1,"This app is like going back in time. It both looks and feels dated. Scrolling does not work properly and once you've decided to continue you purchase Amazon will make sure you can't cancel the operation in a simple way. They even hide the logout option by purpose. I also get very funny notifications like ""maybe you are interested in a cake plate."" What?!"
1,Google play is really bending you over a barrel and your own app store won't support a functioning version of the app??? Limiting Kindle sales so google can make an extra buck. It really is a minor inconvenience that will make me stop using the apps. But that's because it is exactly why I used it. Convenience! Fix your own app store because it currently sucks.
1,Can't open multiple tabs. Mysteriously turns on Alexa which is running in the background of my phone and impossible to turn off. Instructions on how to turn it off don't work. Uninstalling this stupid app!
2,"I've ordered only one thing off this app because luckily it let me pay for it. But everything else I've tried to buy it doesn't let me pay for the item. I've spent about 40 dollars on this app and it still doesn't let me pay for anything. Yes I love the app and everything, but please fix this."
4,"Hi my Amazon app recently turned all Japanese. And I'm not talking about just a switch to Japanese language, but it seems it went fully converted to Amazon.JP. I'm trying to switch it back but I'm unable due to the language barrier. Can I get help on this?"
2,I used to think this was one of those apps that filtered out the broken knock off stuff but as of recent if gotten like 3 bad packages that were like fake copies of games when I'm dropping like 30 40 dollars on them it just kinda syck that they label some bad stuff as good. A little bit more monitoring and maybe this could be an actual shopping app
2,"I don't know what's happened to the app. It was working fine up until yesterday. Everytime I open the app, an error message comes up on the home page. I will have to delete the app if the problem is not resolved."
5,"I have been using Amazon Shopping app. for a yr+, I haven't had any issues & (I'm not tech savvy!) When I like a item but don't want to purchase now, I can save to my saved list,which I have option to create personalized lists.ie; Gifts for Great Grandchildren.Other Options, Buy Again-My Orders-My Accounts-'Sharon's' Shortcuts- Names & address of people I send to-Prime's 'Try before you Buy' is #1. When You Try Amazon Shopping app, I Know You will become Another 5 Star Amazon Shopper ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
1,Not happy. I have amazon prime but now everything is Free shipping if you spend over £20. Prime obviously doesn't count for anything now and o certainly won't renew prime again. Switching to ebay. Most items are free shipping
1,"Gone massively down hill, landing page is always the prime membership even though i have it already, search results are now massive tiles instead of a list. Just a rubbish experience on mobile. I now don't use the app"
2,Great but if you want to make a list it is so dam hard for no reason they need a better function. If you want to move items into a list. So much work. It's so tedious to organize your wishlist 😑
1,"This company has really went downhill. Finally closing my account after getting ripped off for over a thousand dollars. Terrible ""customer service"" and the app is made way too hard to navigate for anything other than buying more junk."
1,"can't switch to my USA account, I have a USA and Canadian address and the app no longer supports switching back and forth. or at least making it impossible to find the option to do so."
1,"So-called ""Same Day"" Prime shipping is actually 4+ day shipping... Might as well drive and buy the items today! Amazon already sucks for undermining small retailers. I already felt guilty using Amazon and the fast shipping was the only thing that made Amazon ""worth"" it. Now the shipping sucks, too, so Amazon isn't worth it any more."
1,"Their experience is worse, I have been waiting for 2 days for their so called fast delivery and still waiting, they don't have an option to call the delivery where the package is, their user experience sucks, the customer care is just playing around transferring chat to one another, I am deleting my account and that's the last time I have ordered."
1,I did order some charging boards for 3.7v battery.Amazon is selling for £ 7.99 and eBay for half the price..(10 boards) I did used Amazon for fast delivery but after a week they changed the delivery date for a month...I couldn't cancel the order... Amazon lied to me about the delivery date...I will never use Amazon again... They are scammers...
1,So the app asks me to confirm my identity by sending me a text message to my previous phone number which I no longer have. I called customer service and after 1 hours they are not able to provide me with access to my account because they cannot confirm even though I provided more than 5 facts from my account. Then they say I can create a new one buy my email is locked into that first account and i don't have another email.
2,"This new update is horrible!! When I open my app it still gives me the same November 1st message from last year, usually all I would need to do is click the learn more and it would take me to my home page, but now it takes me to the web version! Please fix!!!"
2,"Why do I even pay for prime? I order a pair of jeans that I would expect at least a week to ship, not only does it say it won't be here till November but in order for me to get it in October for Halloween I would have to pay 60 DOLLARS. Are you serious? The whole point of even ordering these pants was to for my Halloween costume. Prime is supposed to be about convenience but this is the MOST inconvenient thing ever, 12 days before when I need them and you guys can't even get it to me before then"
3,"Never receive notifications of the statuses of my items. I use to receive notifications when the order was received. The status of the purchase, and when my iten was delivered. Now NOTHING. I do not receive notifications for anything."
1,Everytime this app is enabled I get suspicious email and texts messages attempting to hack my account. Stating my Amazon account has been suspended and if I don't reply it will be disabled permanently. As per Amazon this is false! Never get when this app is DISABLED!
1,"Now there's unskippable 20 second L0TR Rengs of Pewer interstitial ads- they pop up on every Amazon app launch and it cant be skipped. I have Prime and I'm paying $160/yr to watch ads. After being forced to experience Amazon's advertising strategy I would rather drill holes for a dice's 5-face straight into my face. I would never touch L0TR as a franchise, never spend a single $ to their movies or merchandise. I'll remember this. Stop ruining this venerable literature franchise w/ cashgrabs."
1,"Keeps pushing notifications about football games on prime video. This is the shopping app, why is there prime video notifications. Spoke with support and they said they have a deal with NFL and are pushing it to all prime members. No way to turn of these ads."
5,Amazon customer service I would say is the best in the world. I totally recommend Amazon for all your shopping needs especially prime. I'm from Singapore and I absolutely can't live without Amazon prime shopping. Their after sales service is exceptional!
2,I constantly sending emails and getting no response from the developers of the Amazon app. I'm always having issues with it not responding to open on their end no reply.. and it's been 3 weeks.
2,"The Chat function is only available on the app but is broken. Keeps ""getting help"" even though there's someone already chatting with you and alerts come through. It's like the app doesn't want you to reply."
1,"Have few concerns, I have prime membership active and I got another one as a gift. Once I opened it, it activated it immediately instead of waiting until exesting one expires, which should be in a month. Another issue, hey just don't allow me to write comments. Without any explanation. That's discrimination!"
1,"I am just so frustrated with this app I have had this app for quite some time,Fri Oct 14,2022 I got a new phone,and a new number my email remains the same I tried setting this app up with my new info with nothing but trouble. It comes up with a name I do not know some Daniel I can't get into my account. Please get this fixed."
1,"This has become a glitch ridden nightmare. The UI is all over the place and cluttered. When trying to remove items from wish-list will crash the app. Better off just using your browser.update. it's now lagging and stalling. Its impossible to swipe through items as it freezes. A bloated, unintuitive app, main menu button just above the back button🙄. Now I can't view my orders."
3,"Multi-Billion Dollar Company Who can't seem to understand the importance of filters. Why do I get such a diverse group of items to choose from, a lot not even closely related to my detailed search? Invest in making items more easy to find. You may sell everything from A to Z but finding it is often difficult."
2,"I can't comprehend how such a wealthy mega corporation can't fix a simple problem. Way yoo often the product list keeps saying ""Eligible for delivery to Latvia"", yet the product page says ""This product cannot be shipped to your selected delivery location"". Is this too much to ask? Also could you stop trying to sell me Prime? The amount of video content is ridiculously small, the quality of the content is questionable, while shipping to Latvia is never free."
1,"I used to like it, but adding autoplaying video ads to the app is the lowest move. Now full screen ad on startup, absolute garbage app, Uninstalled. You get my money but that wasn't enough so forget you!"
1,"Fraud! That's the word to use after my two days of struggle with Amazon. Despite being Prime member, I didn't recieved the product; whereas Application and email shows product is delivered. Neither delivery service is having the order neither customer care has any idea where the product is."
5,Sometimes I order everything in one day sometimes I put things in the cart and order them one at a time I love Amazon I hate going to stores I got cast on both legs and on my wrist which make it even harder but I like Amazon I like them a lot I use them they're my go-to for darn near everything I can think of have they even sell coffee and they take EBT which I used for a while. Very very very pleased with Amazon would give them 10 Stars if I could
1,Terrible customer service. Can't login cause I changed my number and definitely can't get help. I've created 3 accounts with them this far I'm not doing anymore. Uninstall the app. It's worth it.
1,The amount of impatience I have with this app and Amazon drivers I literally been waiting three days for my package to be delivered what I especially hate is when the driver delivers the package but yet when you go to check if it's there it's not there I don't understand if that's a way for them to mess with people but I hate when they deliver packages to me and it yet it's still not here over and over I have to call customer support just to either get a refund or a replacement
1,"Horrible customer service, especially Amazon Fresh. They didn't deliver my food because of driver problems and then don't properly refund to the correct method when I called to find out what happened. Not to mention I had to make 2 phone calls because they hung up on the first phone call."
1,"They are absolute crooks , do not trust them !!! If you don't receive a package because it's left wherever?they close your account nvm apologizing... can never get service if you ever even find call back??? Items are super cheaply made 95$ % of the time and if you have one too many returns they will then also close your account and won't take the return, they actually told me the delivery people aren't required to read your notes , they can't even call on arrival...for all our sakes do not buy😡"
1,It's forcing me to watch an add for their new shows before I can use the app. Not cool. Now I have to wait until I get on PC to use it. I refuse to watch an ad before I'm allowed to shop or check shipping status.
2,Terrible. I used a gift card and tried to purchase 2 items for free shipping but wouldn't let me proceed to the next unless I put my card details in. What's the point of adding gift card money on to your account if you cant buy anything and also I dont have bank card or credit card. Please sort this issue out as it was so simple and easy before
1,"You guys honestly make me mad and I think this is the last time I'll be using this App. If I order 2 items, why is it that I only get charged for one first, and the second one gets charged at a later date. Not a big deal, but I truly don't understand why you guys don't just charge me EVERYTHING at the same time. What if I take out all of my money from that card for whatever reason, then you guys charge me when there's nothing I the card?? Please fix this ASAP."
5,"I love the app. Works great, no issues. Get shipping notifications, and ""alerts"" for price drops/deals on something I want or may be interested in"
3,"STOP WITH THE ADVERT FOR THE RINGS OF POWER, seriously I PAY for prime, I do not want adverts, weather its for Amazon based products and shows or anything else. I want to open the app and shop. How would you like it if you paid for a membership and all you get EVERY time you open the app there is a flipping advert! You have an advert banner on Prime Video, LET ME OPEN THE APPPPPPPPPPPPPPP."
3,"Very nice app, I wish it would work better with larger phones though. I have the galaxy fold 4. I wish it would make things smaller to allow more to fit on the display."
1,"The app itself is good. The tech support is useless. I reached out to the tech support a month ago and stated that the language setting on my app and website account are set for Canada and as English. However, my emails from Amazon are all in French. I've tried everything and waited a month for it to be remedied to no resolution. It's so frustrating!"
1,Well I had $850 in my cart which I was buying a little each payday aaaaaaand it all disappeared. I will no longer be shopping as I'm mad I took time to research numerous books I wanted to read and now they have disappeared. Yall lost a customer who has been spending a lot over the last 2 years.
1,"They removed where the 'my orders' thing is. Now, when I want to find my orders, I have to put it in the search bar. Plus, I've started buying more locally since stuff now takes a week to show up. Nothing is next day or two days."
5,I have used amazon for many years and I have never been disappointed in anything that I have purchased. It's always on time and if I dont want to have any contact with the delivery person then I can just add a note to the item I have purchased and the drivers have always respected my privacy and left the items I have ordered at my front door and would immediately send me an email letting me know that my items were delivered and out of the many years about 11 yrs that I have bought from Amazon.
1,Im giving one star coz there's no option for zero. I ordered mi one tablet 3 months ago n it wasn't functioning properly and I returned it . They said they couldn't refund the money but could only put it in a gift voucher and after putting the gift voucher they blocked the account till now . I have called several times every customer service personnel asks for something different and when you send the email no one ever replies . I will post all the evidence here .never trust they're fake .
1,Need to take the live off. Don't like it Don't want it.. And remove the applesauce. Every time I scroll down it's there. I don't want the freaking applesauce!! It's been there for months.. Delivery has gotten terrible. It's either delivered by USPS or UPS. Neither is on time or follows directions. Or delivered to the wrong address. Cancelled Prime.. Not paying for something that is not being fulfilled.....
3,"I can not seem to find a register tab. I have logged in just to have my overseer app stat that I still need to register. Any idea what I am doing wrong? Other than that, I'm good. I did have to change my number because the new service I transfered to gave me a number that was associated with another account so I couldn't open my own."
2,"App isn't great, but specifically the fact it plays a stupid Lord of the Ring tv show splash screen everytime I open the app is just the icing on the bad cake. Only good thing is I'm way less likely to spend money, since I close the app rather than sit through the LOTR text"
1,"Constantly have issues regarding the app loading correctly, the app locks me out at least once a day. Constant problems within the app as well in the orders & reviews section. Amazon customer service is useless in the regard."
1,App will not allow you to use the smile section as it comes up with page not found. I feel Amazon have hardly any customer service as their website also has faults it shrinks pages on the tablets and that is getting worse. Amazon please start giving us customers a decent way to buy otherwise you will lose us
2,"Company is going downhill. Should be working on amazon drones and prime same/next day delivery to improve service, instead they remove the ability to buy kindle books easily and make it 10 times harder to download an Ebook.... why change something that didn't need it but keep ignoring the few ideas you have that might actually be beneficial"
1,Now can't ask questions and get errors when adding items to the cart. *Love the service with prime but the app is really pissing me off. The four buttons at the bottom are very annoying. It's inevitable that you pass over it. The swipe left /right in the cart is f'ing stupid and cumbersome. You scroll through and it will randomly delete an item or add it to the cart. There is no button to add it back; you need to go back to the product page to add it again. There are already buttons to delete an
2,"Returns are annoying. I used to be able to print a label, and drop the item in the USPS or UPS box. Both of which are on my way to work or home. Now to ""reduce"" the trucks on the road I have to drive 30 minutes to make a return. Great way to shift the expense to the consumer and put more cars on the road."
1,Needs Dark Mode. The app is easy enough to use. Sometimes it locks up and has issues that shutting down and restart helps. Just really needs to have a dark mode.
2,"App ok, customer service is problematic. Caution buyers. Amazon is applying restocking fees on products they send broken/ defective. SO much of what Amazon sells is junk so, before sending items back, call Amazon tell them the problem and ask how to return it, if it came broken to you. Good luck."
5,Always on amazon. I'm always on amazon. They always have something I need or want. A to Z. Is spot on. I never had a bad experience with amazon and when there was a problem they helped me sort it out. App never lags. And it doesn't harass me about alexa.....don't know if it's cause I already have her enabled or what.
1,"Bad app update, unwieldy UI When a package is late the app shows incorrect information about the point when they will give you a refund. Changing the date from when it was originally promised There is an incessant amount of sales notifications"
3,"Usually don't have problems ordering items, but digital music has been a pain and still is. Always getting errors when trying to order digital music."
1,To the fact that I've not received any of my items its becoming a joke now there saying there going to charge me for not paying for the try before you buy when I never received them I kepted one telling them I've not received my items but they don't give you and options. I always pay for my items with Amazon and it seems like there taking me for a mug. Most of there delivery drivers don't even no how to drive when the come down are road like the other day the driver wasn't paying attention
1,"Bought a trimmer but received a wi-fi router. Opened a ticket with the customer service and the answer killed me: we can't make a refund because you can't send us the original item. Of course I can't, because I've received a WRONG ITEM. Worst customer service ever!"
1,"Since 10/22, Map notifications are sent after delivery now - when app is opened. USELESS 9/22 Why are shipment tracking notifications now only sent after I open the app instead of hours earlier like before? 6/22 After recently re-doing the app, why is there still no direct link to the Orders page like the website? 2022: Need an ""In Transit"" Filter for Orders shipped but not yet delivered. Why can't the What's New section ever be updated??........"
1,"Nightmarish experience. Ordered soap, when it was delivered there was only 1 bar when it should've been 6. So a replacement was supposedly sent but when it came it was a ripped, empty package. So got ahold of support again and they never helped me to resolve this issue in fact they did even not to help, so I never got the soap. Very rude and combative customer service. I will probably end up closing my account. If I could give a -0,I would"
1,"Their customer service is very rude, From the UK right? They really love to hang up on you while you are telling them the problem that's happening from the app and website. Very very rude! If you can't solve them, transfer me to the correct apartment, what is your deal?"
2,"Found out today I cannot change my prime date that it gets removed from my bank account and have to cancel and pay again near the end of the month to restart it, starting to notice this with most subscriptions, wouldn't mind paying the extra to pay to extend the date, please look into this."
3,"Orders take way too long to process. You offer Afterpay option, but your so slow with processing the Afterpay card always expires, creating a neverending cycle of payment revisions and order cancellations. Your vendor section also needs vetting, lots of scammy vendors, actually verified by Amazon, posing as big namebrand companies who they aren't, like Vibrant Jeans fron LA. There's other aspects that aren't so bad like Kindle Unlimited or Prime, but the retail section needs work."
1,"As a customer for 25 years, am disappointed delivery times average 9 days . 4 days worse than last year & 6 days worse than 2020. Where else can you find $10 books selling for hundreds of dollars because of the massive numbers of resellers that hijack book records of other dealers stock and offer them in some cases for as much as 50 times what they are asking for the books! Also noted new books arrive damaged often. So slower, more expensive and often damaged equals no more Prime for us"
3,"As an online store, the app do its job. But, everytime I want to open the app, I get a black screen. I have to restart the app once or twice to see the home page."
1,"Got orders ready on desktop. Then decide to install the app, but can't even find the item. Not does it have anything in the cart I had saved??? How can the search (with Amazon's own suggestions ) end up with nothing consistently?"
5,"I enjoy the app so much I have created an addiction to the prime deals. And it is easy to do your shopping, and return's are even simple. I think it is designed really well."
5,"Great for shopping for what you need especially for your pet. Very reliable and backed by the Amazon guarantee when a vendor fails the customer. Can't look at your orders lately or menu yet alone search and place orders- September 13, 2022."
2,This app is awful u click to look for something and it takes you all over and at the same time when it takes you where you want to it don't give you all wat you looking for. I'm looking for a automatic falcon motorcycle but it keeps giving me only falcon full injection no automatic o nothing bout 20 times I keep looking and no automatic if of not there just say it and stop playing like ring around the rosy with it
1,"While the app is refined enough to allow an easy shopping experience, its also a minefield of scammy subscriptions that you will automatically be subscribed to unless you opt out upon every purchase. We all know that amazon doesnt treat its workers very well, especially in other countries, and this is why i try to leave amazon as a last resort for buying products. Its caught me out a couple of times over the last 2 years and ive missed the automatic subscription that has left me out of pocket."
3,"For the past week the app has not been loading. I have cleared the cache and its been updated a few weeks ago and it worked perfectly fine, until recently. I also uninstalled and reinstalled yet still the same. I have full internet service. I cant access anything on the app to report my issue. Otherwise i love amazon and always ordering things. So plz fix this."
2,"I have to update this app weekly in order to use it. Yes you heard that right, weekly. I attempt to view my order to check the status on them and it just loads and loads and loads. I have to open the play store and sure enough, there's ANOTHER update due."
1,"Uh oh something went wrong... This app keeps crashing. I've tried force stop, clear cache, clear data. I've even uninstalled and reinstalled this foolish app with the same results. This thing is junk"
1,"It seems like my review got removed. Amazon no longer shows actual lowest prices in the Low to High filter. I get a ton of obviously sponsored content that's obviously not the lowest price, like $30-$50. I'm 2/3 down in scrolling before I start seeing what I need."
3,I've shopped a lot on the app and the problem I have is the picture òf the products doesn't always show what you are receiving and when you go to send it back you have a problem I want my moneys worth and that's fine final!
3,I've been trying to purchase an electric bicycle for weeks and each time I put my payment through my order mysteriously disappears. This is the third time this has happened. I'd like to speak with someone in customer service about this because this is getting to be ridiculous.
1,"I thought my prime membership included prime music?? The last update rendered the music app totally useless. Billionaires and their greed make everything worse. And at a time when most Americans are struggling with inflation and high fuel prices. Do better, ya bunch of greedy twits"
2,"Bringing it down a star because they refuse to update the billing situation. If I make a purchase, charge me when I make the purchase. Not 3 days after the fact."
1,The app crashes all the time. I have been using the app for many years but with the recent updates I can't use it anymore.
1,Since the update I cannot get Amazon to load on my phone at all. It says there is an error their end..you must be aware of this! It needs fixed asap
1,DO NOT CHARGE MY ACCOUNT FOR YOUR GOD DAMN KINDLE UNLIMITED IF YOUR APP WILL NOT LET ME CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION. I have canceled this subscription twice and now I am being charged for the service again??? Explain that.
1,"DO NOT USE AMAZON GIFT BALANCE. I I hought I would be able to get my money back since I previously used it and transferred it to my back account. But, if you use a CENT of it you'll be stuck with an Amazon balance and forced to use your money through them. Very confusing and terrible way to trap people."
1,"No more 2 day shipping. At least 5 days minimum. That's absurd since I'm in the Seattle Puget sound area. I don't use video or any other benefits of prime really, so what's the point? Wal Mart and e Bay are faster now. Whelp it was nice while it lasted! Thank you. 🙏 Namaste 🧘‍♂️☮️"
2,"Lately this app works bad: - If I switch countries I can see at the bottom the amount of items on my cart but if I try to open my cart this app always shows my location geography cart instead - Now I have to resort to use the web-browser to admin my carts (US, MX and JP) Please, fix the application!!!"
3,I love amazon so so much. But my account got hacked and the security questions they ask you seems impossible to get 1 right when your answers to the questions should of all been correct but for some reason all of mines was wrong...My account got hacked a couple of days ago and these hackers canceled all my subscriptions accept my prime membership of course. Sense I am unable to obtain my account or get them to cancel the account I will have to dispute the transaction. 😭
3,"Microphone won't work in any field but otherwise good. I can't use your mic or my phones text to speech. Reinstalled, checked permissions. Still same problem."
3,"Good app with a seriously annoying issue. Whilst scrolling, it's far too easy for the app to detect a 'scroll swipe' as 'tapping on a product'. This has (literally) every 10 seconds or so... maybe even more whilst scrolling. It will show me a product I did not want to view. That's my only issue but it's been driving me crazy."
1,"Horrible service. 2 days ago I ordered something and yesterday I recived an email saying that my accound had been closed because Amazon have already closed another account of mine. But the thing is that this was my first ever account on Amazon and I explained them later on email. But I received the same thing every time saying that ""Our records show that we closed another account of yours for not meeting the terms of our Conditions of Use agreement""."
1,"This so-called new and improved app is absolute trash! Amazon has really gone downhill over the last year or so. Prime is a waste of money now. The days of 2 day shipping are over, especially when virtually everything is ""On the way, but it's running late."""
5,Brilliant. Easy to use and convenient but not always the cheapest place to buy from. Some item descriptions are less than accurate.
2,"Amazon promises to cover the cost of returns with prime shipping, however parcel point lo longer accepts the barcode which lets them print the shipping label. This means returns are at your own expense, might as well stick to ebay."
2,"I no longer can access the my orders section. It's in a refresh loop without even the option to search in the order. I would say that's a pretty important feature to have, don't you? The only way i can view my orders are on my computer."
1,"Note 9 - the app will not load , when it requests me to sign in just an infinite loading screen appears. I can use the website on chrome no problem. Ive uninstalled several times and ive cleared cache/cookies. It continues to not work."
3,It's good to use because it can sit at hm & peruse & order items. The app can be cumbersome bc its added so much info that can make it info overload. Their prices have become outrageous. Amazon & Walmart have the best apps around. I had to spk to an Amazon sup once and he was very rude & not helpful.
1,"Amazon has the largest amount of lies in one website! The search engine used for this site is the worst one of any shopping site in the history of shopping sights! A seller can claim to be selling a genuine manufactured equipment and you find out is is a lie after you receive it! And when someone is selling a parody item that is clearly marked, if Amazon doesn't like what it says, they harass a legitimate seller!"
2,This app is always very slow. I open the app and it will freeze for a few seconds until it just closes out on it own. Other than that it's okay.
5,I love it. Lots of items and they are (for most of them) cheaper than any grocery/stores. They deliver and you get an app to watch movies. Great When I have the wrong package or a damaged one or even the wrong color one they are easy to reach back and they understand. They are helping and assisting you. I seriously think this is one of the most honest and responsive online business there is up to date.
1,I don't recommend using Amazon if you ever actually need help from somebody you'll never get help all they do is keep giving you stupid screens telling you to do this do that but they never actually give you someone to talk to or someone to reach out to when you need real help. In short Amazon sucks.
1,"Great app - but demoting to 1 star until I have the option to disable advertising notifications, without disabling account/order/etc. notifications. Add another notification category, for cryin' out loud!"
1,"Unable to change between countries. I move between two countries, and have family and friends in two others, with accounts in each country. I used to be able to change between locations, now the app has me locked to one country, and it is not of use for the foreseeable future! Please update so we can switch between countries like we used to be able to."
2,VERY GLITCHY!!! I hate this version... I've been a customer for far too many years and for the first time I'm so close to taking a break from Amazon and Amazon music because the apps are junk!
1,My phone is on dark mode and I can't see what I am typing in the search bar! It's white on white. Pls fix the dark mode. Also my language is in dutch. I do not speak it and never put it in the settings! Problem is that I can not change it back tho!
2,They moved your orders down to the bottom so you have to search for them to figure out what's showing up what day. The new interface looks cool but is useless for most
3,"Good app, but has been glitching. Lately the app won't show me prime items, but only those with shipping and import fees. It also has been saying I have no orders, and I know that's wrong..."
1,"Nothing but problems with this terrible app. Every sofa I've tried to order either cancels, won't deliver to my area or they constantly ask me to update my payment. And now they put my account on hold for ordering things that I need. No accountability or explanation for any of the blips that occur daily."
1,"App is outdated, won't let you change Prime Video channel subscriptions or audible subscriptions without going to web browser. Search results are apways weird. There should also be a way to toggle to allow sexual wellness items to appear in search results without having to go to that department. Also, searching within a department is extremely clunky."
4,Everything is good but membership is a little high. The app UI is nice but one thing I don't like is the unrelated videos of the product when you scroll down on the product page.
4,"What happened overnight? This app has been great for years! Overnight it stopped working. Nothing new downloaded, no app update. Literally within a few hours it won't work!"
4,"Need to be able to add more info in additional delivery instructions. As for some odd reason delivery drivers do not even attempt to deliver to my address (even though they lie and say they have). I live in an apartment block with concierge at main reception, CCTV throughout the building, plus I have a Google doorbell. Yes there are several entrances, but only 1 for the public. So would be good to be able to post a picture stating where the entrance is like other delivery apps do."
1,From terrible to even worse. All these companies are finding new ways for customers NOT to be able to get ahold of them. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE seems to be the theme. They have changed the app again and of course it is NOT for the better or even a better customer experience. It is just a hassle. What a joke.
1,"App is unusable since the latest update. Constantly getting the error ""unable to add to cart"". Search function brings up items completely irrelevant. Awful."
1,The new ads at the beginning are extremely annoying. Even if you switch back and forth to the app without closing it youstill get that dumb ring of power add
1,"Please stop with the full screen LOTR ad every time when opening the app, or add an option to opt out. It slows down the app start, makes me use the app less, and dislike LOTR more."
2,App seems solid enough but the vendors being allowed to use the app and scam customers is horrible. Blatenly selling knock off fraudulent items and Amazon doesn't shut them down. Time to move on I think. Was a good run while it lasted. Buyer beware when using this.
1,I called customer service to see if the packages I had already paid for were coming and it ordered but never shipped...I spent $300 for the items in the packages that were supposed to be delivered to my house on September 1st. I would give it no stars if I could cause Amazon corporate headquarters kept me on hold a whole hour
1,"The app was working, until November 15th, when is began crashing. Today's update hasn't made a difference."
2,"Dear ignorant Developer's, Quit screwing up the app so dang much. Updated layout completely changed and having scrolling through your insane new layout just to find the order/ order history buttons now. Not interested in the other functions of crud I don't want to use. SMH. Disappointed about this update."
1,"Lost access to my number I used for 2FA and now the only response I receive when looking for assistance is ""Sign in to upload documents"". How can I do that without the number? It's no secret Amazon has a track record of poor employee treatment but perhaps adding dreadful customer service might be a step too far."
1,"I USED to 💓 Amz. Easy shopping, mostly $0 shipping, quick deliveries, easy returns... Since Bezos sold it, it's changed (for the WORSE). Changes we DIDN'T need. Many MORE we NEED but DIDN'T GET. 1) Bulk edits for lists, etc. 2) Payment opts - Gift Card ONCE or ALWAYS (I ONLY use AMZ GC for PRM VIDS, NOT store. 3) Unwanted additions to carts. AMZ has now started adding unwanted items/quantities to my carts. LOOKING DOES NOT MEAN BUYING!!! PLEASE, FIX THESE!!! 'TIL THEN - 1 ⭐ Sorry. 😔"
1,"Amazon deliberately stall dispatch for none Prime members!! Really dodgy practices to force you to Prime, it'll backfire though as I've been trying other online shops and find them way quick and with free delivery. Amazon is not what it used to be, they're getting way too greedy!"
2,"Constant crashes, bad policies, and now the nuisance of the Lotr trailer video playing and hogging data in the background. Will not allow me to ship in peace. Every time I jump to the main menu the idiotic Lotr thing plays. The website is again inundated by shady CCP sellers. Weird fluctuations in pricing of products. Sunday the prices are Rick b bottom, with additional discount percentages, and once the sponsors badge or search shoot is obtained the prices bumped sky high. Stop this farce!"
1,Watch out for shipping date being changed by Amazon to the latest possible date at checkout. App will purposely refresh last second at checkout to the latest date to save Amazon money on shipping. This happens ALL the time. Prime shipping/overnight/next day will CHANGE to 5 day or more by Amazon. Highly deceptive and abusive practice.
5,Amazon has choosen to raise the price of all my products double the price used within my business. Which means i have now chosen to change products and NO LONGER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON. I am losing interest in Amazon due to Amazon's pricing integrity. 1 day look up an item @ 25 bucks. A week later same item 52.00. Disgusting. I am now switching to buy all my business items @ a brick and mortar retailer. C YA Later Amazon.
5,This Amazon App is excellent. Works pretty well. It's fast & convenient. Good for shopping at home. It's easy to use. It's reliable & guaranteed.
5,"becoming a prime member is the best value for money in my opinion ,you can buy pretty much anything you can think of plus free posting/ returns also good TV programs and films and a good selection of books/magazines that change monthly + music. + all the above is available on multiple devices that you own and is always with you. I could go on but I think you get the point. in my opinion a must have utility for all your needs.."
3,The shipping is great and on time the only reason I'm giving it three stars is because when I made the purchase it did not take the money from my account like it should have right then and waited until the last minute and therefore messed up my money this app when making the purchase should take the money out from your account right then
1,Don't use this of you actually need help. The help function assumes you're too dumb to look up common reasons for your issue. There's no reason to use this since you can just access it from your browser and then it doesn't have permissions to access your information.
2,Normally a good app but this latest version is broken. On many pages it just says 'uh oh something went wrong at our end' So app pretty useless right now. I did try clearing data and signing out.
1,"I'm upset, I have been trying to log back into my account and have requested to get an email to reset my password but now the ""customer service"" bot thing just sends me in a loop, so it's a one start for me and as mentioned previously the number for my account is out of use, stop sending codes to it!!"
1,"Personally,based on my experience with this people,I will never order an item through them. None of my items,already payed, arrived to me. No way to speak to somebody of them that can sort out the problem,and the only answer u get is pointing fingers between the Amazon and the seller. If you order something to Amazon,and you pay,u also expect them to do their job properly,not just see them so organized to grab the money,and then what happen after is none of their concerns. Thank you anyway"
1,"Has stopped working since most recent update, just constant loading screen that doesn't result in anything. The app was my primary way of online shopping, paying for prime and can't even use it properly :(."
1,Can't rely on Amazon shopping for anything. Not sure what maps they are using. But they don't even try to find the correct address. Support does not exist. They just don't care about their customers. I am forced to cancel my prime membership and shop elsewhere.
1,"Terrible I made a few orders for my 13yr old boy, mine you he has sensitivity issues -Autism. I recall everything I bought as this was my son's wish. I made sure I purchased items in enough time not just X-,mas and his birthday . He was soo looking forward to have his gaming chair, headphones, Nintendo switch controller, and 2 Nintendo switch games. One 5 nights at Freddy'sa plushy,etc. I've tried to contake Amazon to no availability. Got email stating suspicious activity ?!"
5,"Amazon is such an amazing company. It has everything you possibly want to buy and comes in a timely matter. They have an amazing staff that are so kind and gentle with your packages. To end of with my statement, Amazon is an amazing shopping company and I am so grateful to be able to buy from them"
3,"I can usually find what I'm looking for, but it's so hard to shop on the app because no matter how much I turn my screen down the brightness bothers me. Please consider adding a dark mode for your shoppers with light sensitivity!"
4,"When I click orders, the screen flashes & I cannot see my orders. This has been like that for a long time. Hope they will fix this bug."
1,"Man this app blows, I absolutely love getting deadnamed after setting my name correctly in every single possible way. Plus, all of your orders older than 3 months vanish, never to be seen again, I would really like to know if I got a warrenty on my now half broken headset, but I cant. Sucks to be me."
1,Didn't tell me I needed to have the Amazon app to pickup my package from a locker when it wasn't necessary before. So I had to download this dumb app and run up my data usage. Otherwise my package would have been returned the next day.
5,I'm having problems in putting this app in English. I'm been trying The Past hours and I can't change it from Spanish to English could someone help me out on this situation. thank you very much
1,"You can't even add ideas to a wishlist without a generic failure message. All it says is ""wait some time"" and after waiting or using home wifi, still nothing is fixed."
3,"Please, PLEASE, fix the app!!! I don't speak Spanish, but now all my alerts and notifications are coming in Spanish. This has been going on for about 4-5 days. The rep I spoke with said it was a glitch that would be fixed in 24 hours. It wasn't. 😒"
2,"I'm only giving a 2 star because when you make a order 2 weeks ago and it shows on my card pending there should be no damn reason I have to redo my freaking payment, take the money when the order is placed because I will just cancel and take my money where they get it!!!"
1,I have an immediate distrust of anything that I did not directly install and does (this part I like) has a disable button. It would be better to just let users install it and then decide.
1,Orders are always going missing (again 3rd time) No such thing as next day delivery event though items are advertised as such. Honestly the most unless service I've used in a long time.
1,Keep updating & this app will eventually be nothing but garbage. Filters don't work. Half the time it only remembers 2 of the last dozen things I search for. Only good thing about this app is when I don't use it. Fire the guy who updates this app. He's destroying it.
1,"Horrble to use. It loads up content that's formatted for a desktop/laptop. Try actually making the app mobile friendly, so it loads up the content properly formatted for a phone or tablet."
1,"everytime I go to Amazon I am flooded with woman's clothing, accessories etc completely unrelated to me. it's infuriating, I pay for Prime(not sure why anymore) I also have my search preferences setup.."
2,"After I get this order I am never ordering again for one they charged my card MULTIPLE TIMES and when I called and told them about it they said ""we never received a payment"" when I got the notification saying they did they took 600+ worth of dollars for a order that only costs 345 dollars and refuse to refund me this is absolutely horrible"
1,Last update killed the app! It keeps giving me OOPS screens and closing itself in the middle of searches. Won't load right more times than not.
5,"I mean who doesn't love amazon? I'm just now getting hip to it, and I spent the better part of a day just thumbing through all of the little gidgets and gadgets they have. Don't get me started on the prices, you can find what you're looking for for the low. or go for the high end stuff that's a little more pricy, the choice is yours. As of now it's the only way I shop."
1,Once you ordered and pay it online they deduct it immediately then when you want a refund you'll wait for 2-3 days for the process then another 5-7 days for the refund. Wth is this service. They dont even inform you that they processed it or not if you don't follow up. Never again will order on this app. Waste of time 👎 very bad service
1,Stop changing my language to Spanish! I don't speak Spanish. I don't search items in Spanish. And shockingly enough trying to change the language back is next to impossible when the entire site is in Spanish.
1,I have no idea what's happened to this app first of all I am in Mexico I'm using a Mexican account yet I get the pricing in Euro second all my purchases on my what I've been looking my history is gone because I had the most amazing website and yet you can make such a lousy unpredictable application I can't believe it's the same people who are developing the website are the same hard developing the app
1,Was fine for years but then an 'update' introduced some major bugs. Order history no longer loads and search function is slow to load.
1,"What's the point of having the annoying Alexa button if it's disabled? I don't have, nor will have anything Alexa yet you put the button everywhere? Seriously! Would also love to disable all the auto playing videos/ads too!"
1,I had two packages delivered and they never were at my residence yet the driver did not take a picture which goes against Amazon protocol and as a prime member I should not have had to deal with 6 customer service representatives to then re order them and now it's taking three times as long for the second delivery which they keep changing the date on! I get no answers and now they have emailed asking if I want to pick them up at an Amazon facility instead NO I want you to do your job correctly
1,"Amazon now running shipping fee scam. When making an order over $25 for items eligible for free shipping, they still charge you for shipping."
3,"Latest update appeared to break the app when in fact it randomly changed my region from UK to US and my currency to dollars, changed it back and all was ok but why would it assume I was in the US and suddenly change all the settings, nothing else on my phone suggests this?"
3,The app has started glitching when you go to the tracking page...the page will slightly flicker. App functions properly other than that
4,The new shortcuts lead nowhere . My order pages and search pages do not load so the app is totally useless now. The remedy was to delete and then reinstall the app
1,"It is very strange. When I choose another country, like Turkey, I cannot choose English language. So basically app is useless ("
4,"It's great EXCEPT, it has a tendency to have a 'mind of its own'. I don't want an indepth description but it will go there and getting to customer service is a bit trying but I think they should have more sales on shoes and get more Crocs in..."
2,"Not sure what happened but I cant dislike songs, cant like some songs, and cant go back a song sonetimes. Random bugs make it frustrating."
5,"So many people in the reviews bitching about how the ads and others getting in the way and basically just saying they can't use amazon with common sense. Great app, use it for shopping 24/7."
1,No way to connect with customer service. As I have a problem with one of my order. I do not get my order even it pass expected derivery date. I am not able cancel the order.
5,"The save for later is unmanageable for people like me. Can you make the save for later section click-able, so it will take you to graphed/listed pages with everything on it?"
4,I love amazon. But shipping to Puerto Rico take at less 2-3 weeks and that being a prime member. Also they put a hold on the amount of your order until they ship it and then change you for your order. So basically they charge you twice until the bank takes the hold off your money🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
1,Filter button opens to an unusable and partially non-functional menu. I really expect more from Amazon.
1,Changed it so you automatically change payment methods and charge second card without authorization. Just desperate. Also can't cancel right after I ordered the package
2,"Seems like over the past few months it's gotten more difficult to find what I want in the search window. It seems no matter HOW I word it I don't get what I'm asking for. This was my last resort, but this is tiresome and very time consuming! What has happened?"
5,"Very easy to navigate. All items i have browsed/ordered so far have been acurately described,picture and correctly priced/charged."
1,"Whenever I open a product page I get ""We're sorry, an error has occurred. Please reload this page and try again"" on my Z Fold 3 This happens for any product It works fine with the web browser."
2,Amazon...a multi-billion dollar logistics company that allows its drivers to decide if they feel like delivering certain items on any given day. Sounds like a great business model.
2,Was great at first now I'm locked out my account cause of the activity on my card when I'm the only one using it I even sent pictures of reciepts from other places I used it at in person and yet still locked out so don't enjoy it to much they will lock you out and want you to share your personal business to get back in
1,"Where to start App is rubbish, constantly crashes . Deliveries now also rubbish Definitely NOT handed to resident No longer leave photo of delivered item. Presumably you're not allowing drivers sufficient time to deliver properly . Get a grip Amazon, service now v v poor"
1,"Wow, nice job amazon. You promised to deliver an item on time which was amazon prime, no sign of delivery even after 1 week of eta, I had raise a complaint through their chat support n threaten with a consumer complaint to get the refund, gave my experience as feedback/review, now my account is blocked from all reviews and all past ones removed. I guess Google should block this app :D"
1,Items that are marked for 1 day delivery are always delayed by a few days. They are always delivering to the wrong address and our house is not hard to find.
1,"I can't log in at all, I'm entering the correct info, it tells me to check my connection. Yes, my connection is good and to a good wifi connection."
1,"Please fix returns through the app the button stays greyed out despite having your ""recommend"" service selected, yes you don't f up often but a mattress topper is not a turntable or a suitable substitute!"
3,"The app often crashes with the excuse ""oops something happened on our end"". IF YOU KNOW THERES A PROBLEM, FIX IT!!!!!!! IE you don't care about your customers."
2,"it's a shame what it has done to the high streets of the world but, I can purchase stuff cheaper, I guess... Sometimes it just closes itself. Shops on the high Street never did that."
1,Awful app awful company. App used to be good as did their customer service when you called. Both shocking. Need a UK call centre not just offshore. Been a prime member for years. No longer as just cancelled. Goodbye useless app and awful company
2,Good app if you don't feel like going to the store and looking for certain items but if you're thinking about paying with gift cards think again it does not like when you pay with gift cards after the first time
1,Since the update again tapping the little X to delete a history line item no longer functions again why can't we just have a setting not to keep history I don't understand that Amazon why do you have to keep my search history when I don't want you to please somebody from Amazon answer that
1,Every order is a month last can't get a delivery. Have no problem whatsoever getting my stuff from China .. but when I order through Amazon I get a run around. My order are from California and it takes 3 months to get it?🤔
3,"I love Amazon however, my language setting changes to Spanish all the time. I only speak English so do tell how I am suppose to change that if I can't read it and I would say most important WHY!!!!!! I have to uninstall/reinstall all the time!!!!!"
3,I felt like it was misleading and it's wording you guys say comforter blue red comforters set with sheets not blue red cover or comforter cover and now I'm stuck with something I can't use I don't even know what comforter with fit that are go in it or what's best to get and I feel like if you need guys know that and can facilitate it would think that you can reconcile this with sending me the comforter that goes inside of that I would have never paid $60 for cover when I paid less for the sheets
1,"Haven't had prime in months because I can't find a job and can't pay for anything, parents let me use their card for food, I consider buying something in Amazon but don't, input card but never charge anything, Amazon automatically started pulling $16/mo off the card without consent. Deleted the card, scum bag Bezos is out to steal from the poor."
1,I typically like Amazon but my past 2 orders have been 2 days late. I pay for prime and specifically purchase prime products but they keep coming late. If this happens again I'm canceling prime and will just start using ebay
1,Utter rubbish.. spent 1hour to becable to open a bloody locker.. had to give loads of permissions (location bluetooth mic files .. bloid type and shoe size) in order to get what I purchased. Not to mention the stupidity off theconw who taught that you can't get a code if you are using a pc! .. it only works with amazon stupid app..
3,"Live Stream feature annoying. On the home screen you have to dance around the new live stream ""feature"".. if you try to scroll down the page like normal, there is no click, pull the screen up motion on the live stream, as soon as your finger touches it.. boom, you're watching Greta talk about some new fancy caffeinated water with 0 carbs, no trans fat and it's gluten free too.. wow. Amazon, stop ""making"" us think about how we scroll. We won't buy as much stuff if we're not mindlessly scrolling."
5,"I love,💓💓💓 this app!! It literally has pretty much anything you could ever want to buy!! Plus the 🤑🤑prices are amazing and you can't beat their shipping..."
1,"Horrible experience! Never works properly, always crashes. Terrible connection issues. Don't waste your time use the website!"
1,Be sure to check your subscriptions. They automatically include coupons that require you to get a subscription for that item now. Literal small print scam stuff here.
1,Every time I try to use at whole foods it sends me a verification code to my phone but I never receive it!!! Then locks me out of my account. Very frustrating!!!!!
1,"How rude, and mocking! We thought you'd like? No, I've never been interested in any of these notifications, yet there's no option to disable just them? Please change this - I don't want your spam notifications!"
1,Amazon uae is the worst online marketplace. They sell inferior goods at higher prices and the most annoying part is the delivery service. They lie to customers on delivery date and fail to deliver on time. They have bunch of unprofessional delivery personnel who doesn't check the identity of the customer during delivery. They just handover product to anyone in your apartment. Their courier are the worst in uae. I wish I could rate them 0.5 rather than giving them 1 star. They are just hyped
1,I never got a knock on the door only a emailed pic and when I checked 1 min later there was no package. Never using Amazon this cr4p just keeps happening to me and I'm tired of losing my money.
1,"Amazon is rubbish , I bought a $20 gift card an Amazon sent it to my email , but when I went to my email an clicked on the link to get the gift card it keeps saying oops try again later an won't give me my item . It fails to load , an when I tried to refund it because it doesn't work got told I can't"
1,This company is getting worse and worse as time goes on like all companies do eventually. They are not issuing cash refunds anymore but instead gift cards. Do not use Amazon find another place to buy goods online that's newer and still treating their customers good.
1,"Dumbest online store on the face of the planet that doesnt take the $ for your order until your order ships, litterally the only store that dosent take your $ immedeatly after submitting a order.. and when they dont keep to the 2 day shipping promis they are not willing to admit that they messed up on that and the way they accept payment is bs... idc if it takes 3 extra days so long as my order is already paid for and im not waiting 5days for amazon to move stuff to the supply center and take $"
5,Amazon is mostly on point with the time your package will arrive and the product we order is always what we pay for. I would definitely suggest Amazon to my family and friends when it comes to online orders.
3,"Too many inauthentic products.. i think amazon should do something about this, or at least check the seller's bills and papers before selling their products on your application, after all it's affecting your credibility and your name."
3,"I am getting really tired of your apps always crashing, glitching or doing something strange ( ALL AMAZON APPS! THE AMAZON MUSIC, AMAZON PHOTOS, AMAZON SHOPPING, LITERALLY ALL OF YOUR APPS SUCK!!!!) I KNOW DAMN WELL JEFF BEZOS IS NOT ON HIS LAPTOP AT HOME 24/7 FIXING THESE ISSUES BY HIMSELF. HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS ACT LIKE A BILLION $ COMPANY AND NOT SOME START UP. JESUS F@$KING CHRIST!!!!"
2,Really guys. What update did you do now. Your app is so slow and hesitant. Nothing else on internet is slow. Even deleting something from cart takes forever. Why is app so slow.
1,"Wish I could give 0 stars. Can't rent or buy anything from our android apps anymore because Amazon won't pay the fee play store is asking for. You can only do it from a browser website now. Amazon, you are 💩💩"
1,"Ordered on the 5th ive been giving 3 different delivery dates, only to find out they were out of stock and they were ordering and shipping my items from a completely different company."
1,"Removing the sign-up to the prime option on the app is a big mistake, the app is pointless now if you need a computer to sign up and download various things to your account."
1,"It is a lousy application and I bought several things and I put a card and they blocked my account, I spoke and they told me to open another one and how many accounts would there be, they blocked them and I sent the documents they asked for and nothing"
5,"I LOVE AMAZON PRIME AND ALL ITS BENEFITS ARE AWESOME. I ONLY PAY LIKE $7 A MONTH BECAUSE I GET FOODSTAMPS OR WHATEVER, AND I CAN ORDER USING FOODSTAMPS, FREE SHIPPING!, I WATCH SHOWS ALL THE TIME, LISTEN TO MUSIC, AND MORE!!!! I LOVE AMAZON PRIME."
1,Filters don't work. You choose sort by price and the search item is removed and it's random items.
1,"I ordered some ""Alex plus"" caulk for some renovations because my house is leaking water, the caulk that ended up being delivered was ""Alex fast dry"" and I didn't realize until I was done with the tube, I tried using the wrong item was sent option and it wants me to return the used caulk before I can get my new caulk shipped out, my house cannot wait, parts of my house are now ruined because I have to wait longer to get it, why should we use Amazon if you're not going to send the right things"
1,"Worst service ever, the app doesn't send notifications. Customer service is the worst, they cannot assist you with anything."
1,"Allowing a bunch of scamming products on there site. You wait 2 weeks. They say package ""lost"", wait another week to get your money back. Amazon doesn't care at all. Only wants your money, they can care less that you need items order after going threw hurricane Ian. Not there problem but they will take 2 sec to pull money out your account. Then the customer service will tell you its not there fault or problem."
5,I love this app the best shopping experience and the easy way to manage your account is all with this awesome app highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!
1,It is now incredibly difficult to switch between accounts since you now have to sign out in the accounts management on your system instead of in the app itself since it was removed.
1,I bought $100 worth of items and never received it and I bought a 2 year warranty on that item. They wouldn't return my money on that warranty. Buyer beware. Amazon customer service doesn't understand English. Don't buy from Amazon if you don't want to be robbed. Report to Ohio Attorney General.
2,too many apps on my phone. onoy adding for the free 10 dollar credit to finish my order after shopping online. app is too hard and too demanding for phone space.
5,"Always the best prices, with a huge selection and super fast delivery speed! Love it!"
1,"Sometimes leaves me with buyers remorse because a lot of vendors don't ship to Hawaii so I have to choose the more expensive vendors. Also 2 day shipping is never works out here too. Either stop offering it to people in Hawaii or make good on the offer. Order something on Sunday night, products don't even ship out that same week. Customer service treats me like they understand how the mail system works in my own town better than me. And now they stole Thursday night football... Amazon sucks"
1,App constantly freezes since the last update. I've tried to troubleshoot for 5 days and had no luck.
3,I don't like the swipe to delete option. I was trying to scroll and accidentally deleted 3 things from my cart and can't find them again.
3,Why is viewing my order history such a problem? More often than not I can't. This has been an ongoing problem for quite some time now. Any chance in getting this sorted?
1,"I didn't like it at all. Everytime I closed the app or went on a different app, my entire shopping bag was empty. After I did all my shopping."
3,"Great app, just wish there was an actual app on android instead of having it integrated. I find myself going to the playstore to look for it and then opening it from there."
5,"Affirm payments through Samsung web browser for my Samsung Galaxy A50 (Canada) goes all the way through until you try to confirm the order. Then it goes to Amazon page that says ""Looking for Something? We're sorry. The Web address you entered is not a functioning page on our site. ￼ Go to Amazon.ca's Home Page"" Still having issues with the Affirm option. Although I have made several purchases now. Just tried to order 1 Flat Out Sportsman bottle for my Ebike and to no avail."
3,It would be better if it didnt switch languages everytime i open the app. One time in English next time in Spanish even though my settings are for English only
1,App doesn't actually tell me when I've bought things even though I have the receipts in my email. My orders refuses to show me current or past orders. Will be deleting
1,This app keeps freezing every time I move stuff from my list. It's getting to the point where I'm about to delete the app all together
1,May as well buy on ebay. The only reason to have prime is 2 day shipping. I'm not paying monthly for you to tack on three handling days.
2,"Music changed to them picking my play list shuffle. Next day delivery can be 1 or 2 days. Service is sucking for the price increase, but they own rockets so screw us customers."
1,"Beware of SCAMMERS in Amazon Warehouse. Amazon won't give me a refund for an item which was replaced by a Plastic PCB. They cant give a refund even though I have the official statements from the Freight company that I used, Photos while unboxing, uncut version of the Video of actual unboxing. Associate are not being honest and too lazy to provide correct answers"
5,"What's not to love? Just be aware of where you're shopping and what you're shopping for and you will be fine. I have Amazon Prime, I love it and it'll save you money in the long run with deals and free shipping. I would be a spokesperson for them if I could be."
2,The latest version forces me to watch a commercial upon opening?? I couldn't possibly dislike this more. I pay for prime and just want to shop for something. I don't want to have to watch your promo for some movie you are promoting first. Horrible mobile experience!!
3,"The only issue I have is no dark mode, for a large company with a huge audience you would think they would want the app as accessible as possible. 2 stars gone until they bring in dark mode."
1,"Can't view my orders. For a few weeks, it's been hit and miss if I get to see the orders list page which. Its getting annoying as I use that page to check when an item is arriving or to rebuy things I've bought. I've not been able to see my orders for two days solid now. It just goes to that awful dog page. Update: Contacted the developer and only received a generic email back with no mention of the problem I've had. Still not able to view the order page."
1,I am very disappointed with the 3 representatives I spoke with this morning regarding a return that I decided to keep called last Monday when I got paid to pay for the item in question and was told that Amazon was taken care of it for me not to worry about it last night I received a email that says I need to pay for the item on or before a certain day. I call and you can't verify my account somehow changed my password through some link that I told this lady 5 times was telling me to change it.
1,"Back to top is annoying. Amazon customer since 2002. I spend TON$ on Amazon, even purchasing Amazon internationally. I've reviewed MANY purchases. However, Amazon admins have been CENSORING any review I leave that is negative. Several people in my immediate and extended family have also received this type of censorship. My reviews are honest, concise,.and fair. It is Amazon who is CENSORING REVIEWS! Can't scroll ""My List"" on OnePlus 6T. video ads playing are annoying, no option to disable."
1,"Prime is not what it was, and the price cost more than a non prime article from the same sellers delivery date are similar. For a day or two you can save up to 1/3 of the cost without any subscription fee..... Plus there's near no existant client service. You don't get much out of it at this point. The app hace some crash here and there. The language keep switching from English to French for no reason. Subscribe items not always shown...."
1,I was a huge fan of the app until Google Play and Amazon decided to change up their relationship guidelines and the way you can purchase ebooks and their audible books. So I'm basically paying for a service I can only use once a month when I receive my 1 free credit from audible. So damn annoying!! I have reached out to the help team a few times and instead of walking me through on how to purchase the audible books myself they will send me a link to purchase the book.
1,"App keeps freezing up, when I use my list, or trying to look up orders, tried several different things, nothing seems to help, any ideas on what to do, to fix?"
2,"The main reasons for the 2-star rating is the following: With such a massive range of products to offer, at least ensure that your FILTERING and SORTING options work flawlessly. They are pointless. For example, search for an item, 10000 results found, try to sort it by price from low to high, then only 200 items remain! Where did the other 9800 items go? Same happens when you sort by ratings, relevance, etc. different results. Also, so many rubbish and repetitive products listed. Reviews fake!"
1,Do not trust your credit/debit cards with Amazon. This morning I got an alert saying my bank was overdrawn due to $16 being fraudulently charged by Amazon. I have not used Amazon in 2 months and removed my cards from the app. Going through my bank statements for the past 2 years on the same day every month my card was charged 16 by them. The monthly fee was only $6.99 which was also charged monthly. This is illegal and they should be investigated.
1,I am very very upset with Amazon and Prime I had 10 dollars left in my case app account they I needed for gas and Amazon took $6.86 from me and I had no clue because I didn't order anything from them at all I want my money back.....
1,The app is full with bugs and every time when you think is ok another appears. The sorting is a mess the filter is almost unusable and if you filter by price more than half of the items found will disappear and the products have prices like it is mixed! Better use the site although there is the same problem with the filters!
3,I can't stand the new previewing videos that automatically play as I browse. They're awful. Otherwise the app is fine except the whole Kindle thing which is a real pain.
3,"Ayo ayo, how come right after I am forced to buy two more things than i wanted due to 25$ minimum for free shipping, they send a notification less than I have time to look at my order saying free shipping any purchases! That targeted af and they prolly got multiple people😅😮‍💨"
1,"Despite having a yearly household subscription to Amazon Prime, this app says that my prime membership was paused asking with my benefits as a Prime member. The only way to prove that I have a membership is to order something with Prime, which makes it difficult to get anywhere about Prime with their CS reps. Useless."
4,"Amazon app is rekatuvkgoid but it's not letting me upload photos of items ordered & received, even though I've changed device app settings to enable this...🤷🏽‍♀️"
4,"I strongly urge Amazon to put this app in the Galaxy store for Samsung. DO YOU REALIZE GOOGLE IS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE GAME APP FROM AMAZON FOR ANDROID?? They are. I research my Samsung devices so I KNOW, I CAN USE my Samsung Internet Browser. Ggl has specifically REMOVED ACCESS to the AMZN APP & the necessary tool required to access it. You stink ggl & I'm gonna begin to get ALL MY APPS OUTSIDE your platform. I OWN MY PHONE. Tech giants beware, they're out to get you to. Hah 😆 🤣"
5,Great app. Great people. And the delivery agents. But help the delivery agent with Heavy packaging. Reduce the stress for the women. And better signing for the package too in the app then having give the delivery agent get me to signed . Or the app or delivery agent. Help them remember. Thank you.
1,"Bloody annoying! Until a recent update, I had the option to disable 'Alexa' from asking me what I was looking for and then ""Showing results"" Now, I can't find away to silence 'her'. Damned annoying."
1,"Amazon: if you don't kill the NFL notifications, or give me a setting that does, I will not only uninstall this app, but will also consider cancelling my Prime subscription. I do not pay you for the privilege of becoming your advertising crash test dummy, and I am offended you think otherwise."
1,"Prime sale, all 💩 I DON'T need?!? How end chat if agent hanging? U force me 2 get ""help"", turns into a return! I can do that! Where's ""forced"" HELP? Prime Member SHOULD NOT be FORCED 2 LOOK at ADS, ESPECIALLY VIDEO AD! That's WHY I PAY Prime Membership! Raising prices again (sports, I DON'T Want/Ask4)! App is OLD & BRIGHT! DISLIKE overhaul menus & BUTTONS! Vanishing 🛒, find items now $5 more? So tired of merchants denying warranty service & Amazon LET'S MERCHANTS Continue to sell 💩 & LIE! 😡"
4,Amazon sucks some items on here like to double charge and Amazon doesn't notice neither do they seem to care just ordered a 106.70 pair of work boots and it took the money out the account and this morning it's trying to take the exact amount again just under different name under Amazon and I haven't ordered anything else other than the boots for that price so what am I being charged for twice
1,"Crooked company. I have been a loyal customer to Amazon for years and spent well over thousands on their services between prime and shopping. Never once have I lied, stolen, or cheated this site. I requested a return for an exercise bike, the return was due by NOVEMBER. I'm a very busy person and had planned to return the bike by this upcoming Saturday as Khol's is a decent drive. Amazon took the money from my account an entire MONTH before the due date. Seriously?! You guys overdrafted me!"
2,"Very much DISLIKE the new search filters. Removal of the ""Low to High"" price filter makes me like I'm being SCAMMED, can't be confident I'm getting the best price. Ruins my shopping exp"
1,Took 9 whole hours for the package to get here bad service they always change the time it could be 10 am then 1-2 2-3- 3-4 -5-7 they change and change one time it came at 9 30 like it's about to be midnight so yeah its crazy the always mess up packages it's good for buying but anything else big no I recommend never buying food it will always get old
2,"This app can be annoying to use in many ways. I hate that when I click on ""my orders"", it shows me the ""buy again section."" It doesnt show an order in my orders if the order happened too long ago. Just many small money making things that are irritating enough for 2 stars. Also, the new ad whenever the app is opens is very annoying."
1,App crashes way too much to be able to use it. Ive used amazon for years so im not sure if it was just an uodate gone wrong or what but it wont stay open long enough to even search.
1,"I don't like the new update. I like the old version where you can filter prices from Low to High, now it was changed to Up to $25!"
3,Now used prices dont show up in list view... Not going to click on every item to see if used is available and price.... I wish you could search only within Amazon warehouse like on the computer. You can only browse Warehouse in this app....
1,"Do not use!! Over 10x ive had issues that have nothing to do with any fault of my own and yet instead of making up for it I just hear ""oops?"" Basically. Terrible company. They try to say the customer comes first but trust me, u come last...update 11/2021 even worse now its charging me for stuff I didn't order?! I have like 3 items I didn't even order being shipped to me that I'm charged for now? Man what is wrong with this company, no customer service and middle eastern service"
1,"Sucks. Has search filtering, but search sucks and filters don't work at all. Applying filters often removes matching content and adds many items that do not match."
1,I have reported my issue that my account has been disabled and i was ordering some required items for me. I called customer service They reported it and said that you will receive an email. after i receive the email i called them back they said that you need to reply the email but it's not possible to replying and then they took my informations and reported again so I'm still waiting to get my account back. Why this process is not ending and what is the reason of that i have no idea.
3,"What happened to the 2021 app version that organized orders by their delivery status and not their order date?? It was so nice to see the items that had not yet been delivered at the top, then everything that had been delivered below!"
2,"Was great but not now: SLOW! It lags when loading and will not allow me to shop or review in a timely fashion. I've tried several ways on my end to remedy the problem, but the app is not functioning as it should."
1,"App no longer works. Only the ""home"" and ""cart"" buttons works. Everything else just displays a white screen. It appears as though Amazon no longer want people to shop with them"
2,Way to much data and screen space in app being used for ads. Consuming large volumes of mobile data plan when using. It's grown to being significantly less useful of an app.
1,Last gui update is terrible. Everything useful is now deeply hidden. Can't find previous orders or where to enter gift cards without great effort searching through ambiguous labels.
4,Lack security to log out. Plus u can't change your cell # in the app. It not same account info that on their web site. Please update. Than I can give it 5 stars
5,I do a lot of Shopping Online because you simply get better deals and prices. Amazon has this and so much more. Be a Smart Buyer. Amazon Buyers are really smart. Don't be fooled by Wantabes and Copycats. Trust Amazon; I certainly do because they have proven themselves again and again.
1,"App kept changing language to Spanish for no discernible reason. All the customer service could do was help me restore it back to English, but they could not prevent it from recurring."
1,HORRIBLE. Heating up phone and draining battery. Has been VERY LAGGY and has crashed a few times. Listing photos take forever to load or do not load at all.
1,"You moved the orders button?!??!! I don't need to see more sales garbage!,I need to keep track of my orders. I can't believe I now have to scroll down through your page of garbage to click into ""my stuff"" to find it. You suck!!!"
3,"Functions great but my goodness, the prime day ads are insane. The popup everytime I open the app, which has caused it to crash as well."
2,App aas fine until they updated something about 3 months ago. The app crushes or don't load the content. I fully understand if you have an issue for couple weeks but for 3 months and no fixes...? Really? I really dispointed in your services but I still hope that this will be fixed soon
5,Fantastic app. Been using it and Amazon for years however the latest update (Dec 8 2020) has bricked the app. It consistently crashes on startup. Please fix.
2,"I dislike that I place an order to be delivered today (the next day) and over 12 hours later (closer to 24) the order is finally placed and I will now be getting my order tomorrow. It's false advertising that I can get something same day, or even next day when it takes almost 24 hours for an order I place to actually go through."
5,"When I say I LOVE this app, it's no understatement! I literally use it every day whether it's just for browsing to add things to my wishlist or getting things on the fly. My favorite app hands down."
5,"I've been using Amazon for many years. I can't believe how simple, secure, and easy to use the Amazon app really is. Place and track your orders right from your Amazon app📲!"
1,Amazon is getting bad I used to love shopping with them but now it's getting to the point where even if you order something and they canceled it there's no side of it I'm trying to get ready for winter and I ordered snow pants a snow jacket gloves and much more and they canceled my order without me approving it or knowing about it so now that I'm looking for the things that I ordered it's no longer there Unfortunately they allowed me to get my snow boots but wasn't able to get my other stuff.
1,"1. A cheap clickbait strategy: I always see a lower listing price but as soon as I click on the item for details the price multiplies or suddenly isn't available to my destination but I can have it for a higher price. 2. This Amazon policy to push noname ""featured"" items to first places and not what I searched for drives me crazy. 3. Opened a link that changed the app to .es including it's language. How to change from Amazon.xx to Amazon.yy and back without reinstalling the app? No such way."
1,"This app is a real mess.It takes tooo long to receive your order and order is not the right one.Delivery men usually come to the wrong destination and at a completely different time.If you want to return or replace an order,the app tells you that you will receive your new one after a month or more. There must be more respect for the clients...The delivery men sometimes don't call to confirm that you are at home and if they called, they might not come that day."
5,"I love shopping and Amazon definitely makes it much easier. 98.5% of the time I find exactly what I'm looking for and shipping is also timely. I really appreciate that they have so many tools for you to ensure that the item you want is really what your looking for. My favorite part are the reviews, where buyers can express with honesty details about their experience with items quality, functionality, longevity etc. I spend hours searching and saving items for when I'm ready to buy. It's awesom"
1,The app won't let me add multiple things to cart. I'm also unable to see my whole shopping list at once. The app also keeps making me change the country and sometimes just sticks on a blank screen afterwards. Also the Rings of Power pop up advertisement seems to make the app crash.
1,I cannot see orders. It just keeps refreshing the screen over and over. Has been this way for months. FIX IT ALREADY
1,They make it almost impossible to change a seller review. The seller review has a bigger impact than i though. Making a simple mistake can do a lot of harm. I dont know if the techs are lazy or under paid but its pretty ridiculous that after hours of trying to get through to a real customer service human i get told they cant help either
5,"In the Deliveries section of the Subscribe & Save, it would be really helpful if it showed the total cost of that delivery and not just the individual prices of the items being sent. That way I know the full amount my card will be charged after it's all shipped. Otherwise, I absolutely LOVE ❤️ the app!! I never experience any slow loading others have mentioned. I literally will spend 8 hours at a time, couple times a week, looking for the perfect items to add to my cart and buy on pay day!!"
3,"Since the latest update it doesn't allow Fitbit to connect to use the voice assistant on the smartwatch. I tried to set up my new itbit Sense to use the voice assistant, and I get an error the the Amazon Shopping app keeps crashing when the Fitbit tries to connect. When I tried to do this on another device, I got an error message that there was a bug in the Amazon app, and this feature couldn't' be used until the bug was corrected."
1,constantly bugs me to use features I don't and won't ever want Edit: started sending ads though package notification channel. autoplay audio was the last straw. Uninstall
1,"Terrible company, changes the delivery date 3 times a day every day for 2 weeks until it finally arrives and gets thrown at your door step. If you want a reliable delivery service that sticks to what it says, don't use amazon"
1,"The app stopped working just like that. It says that I don't have internet connection, but I do. Reinstalled the app and had the same issue. It won't let me sign in. Please help. Thanks"
2,"I have used Amazon for maybe going on 2 years was just a once n a blue moon kinda thing before the past 8 to 12 months and I have got into RC Car Hobby heavily. I never noticed many issues I had to refresh several times more then I thought should have been doing, especially with the Shopping Lists, after reading the reviews I see the issue is not my phone and is the App j figured due to where I live as even wifi speed can vary but my phone works great but the app lags far amount and is annoying."
3,For some reason on occasion I'll buy an item and it'll never show up or once it arrives in my mail and turns out to be garbage and I want to make a review or contact seller the seller page and item is completely gone from Amazon. This leaving me with no way to get a refund or anything.
1,"None of the packages have shown up on time. Currently have a water heater that says delivered and is not here. Said it got here yesterday but says it's in powel. I don't live in powel.... app won't show anything about refund, lost packages or customer service. Am currently canceling Amazon prime account. Don't recommend this company."
1,What happened to my shortcuts? They are all gone. How do you add them back? Not intuitive at all. Filters are also broken. This updated app is terrible.
2,"The my account tab, or whatever it's properly called, will not load. The rest of the app is basically functional, but can be unbearably slow."
2,The app works fine except for the one glaring problem. You can't see what you are typing on the search bar. Kind of a big deal at least for me.
5,"It's definitely my go-to shopping app. I buy pretty much everything for daily usage from Amazon. And whenever I need something. Because it's so fast. And we got a new Amazon fulfillment center built nearby. So much so, I've been with Amazon for over 20 years since it's just an online bookstore and I needed used college textbooks. No matter what other would say, since Amazon is getting indispensable to me, the app, of course, is helpful."
1,"Prime no longer works? I'm no longer able to access the ""Prime"" section of the app, very cool you wonky-eyed tard. Fix the app please."
3,Update: Google now localizes reviews so you won't see any satisfaction/disatisfaction from other countries; this may now make you miss the whole picture on reviews. I want to remove the Alexa icon from the application. The Alexa icon takes up some space. I do not use Alexa and do not plan to for now.
5,It would be nice to have a dark theme for the background of this app. It would be easier to be looking at my phone in the dark without straining my eyes because it's so bright.
1,"False advertising. They scam you with 2-day prime delivery, you sign up and the same purchase is NOT applicable for prime. Therefore when you cancel they pocket some of your money spent on prime and or screw you with the delivery/shipping costs. DO NOT SUPPORT NEOCAPITALISTS!"
2,"I don't get notifications to the app anymore about shortly arriving or delivered deliveries. Drivers very rarely ring a doorbell or knock the door. There is an out-of-view place on our doorway, just most drivers don't think and they place packages in front of the door, clearly visible from the street. I haven't given unfavorable review about delivery, yet. Main reason is that Amazon's options for choices. I may have to use ""unprofessional delivery"" option. How much trouble there is to knock?"
1,Removing old orders is a real issue. I order things that I have used and liked but not any longer. Now I will look at physical stores first. Might get rid of Amazon.
1,"Search still sucks. Ignores terms. Android has dog errors on pfsense. Ios doesnt. Greeeat. a new app to deal with. and everything isn't where it was. Let's make it harder. Please next, start scrolling horizontally cause yeah ""cool"" ""different"". Apple. Pointless horrible update imo. It just shows how out of touch Amazon is. Still no place to leave app feedback. Oooh, no line separators. Nice now it's harder to read. Apple. Bright white. Update. Shamwow. Good job. Amazing."
1,"Terrible customer service. Sent me the complete wrong items, but won't give me a refund until I return the junk the sent me, which is a huge inconvenience for me- like an hour on public transit to and from the nearest whole foods. This company can go to hell."
5,I probably use this app more than any other. I shop here regularly and the app is very easy to navigate through. The items are very good value for money. Delivery is also very good and I can't criticise it at all. I sent back an item that never made it back to Amazon. I was told not to worry and the problem was sorted without any fuss. The Amazon wardrobe is the ability to order items without paying and you only get charged if you decide to keep the item and you just send the rest back.
1,"I have 3 amazon accounts. Unfortunately i wasnt told whenever u switch phones or phone numbers apparently u have to update it on ur account BEFORE u switch, because once u switch u basically cannot log back in. I tried calling Customer service but the security questions are ridiculous 'name some devices with their serial numbers linked to ur amazon account' Who has that!? Especially if u move around every year. Now they told me I can link my previous emails aslong as i make a 4TH account."
1,"Amazon has locked my brend new account cause my old phone was hacked into just gotten a new phone and made a whole new amazon account and this past Friday I order five items from them and that's when they locked my account they said it ""its temporary on hold"" I spent $168 on everything! and if I don't get packages today I will be a very very mad person I was looking forward for it everything was for Halloween...I'm ashame of you amazon I didn't even do anything wrong"
1,"Recently they keep advertising fast shipping on items but then default to the slowest possible shipping, even though faster shipping is free and included w Prime. It means I have to triple check shipping options before buying, which is super irritating, and results in me needing to cancel orders the times I forget to check... often after days are lost waiting. Give me the fast shipping you advertise or don't provide the benefit!!"
4,"Search filters are extremely poor, for the lack of a better word it sucks. Amazon in sg is already plagued with poor quality retailers (I.e some unscrupulous drop shippers). Previously we can filter these overpriced drop shippers out. Now you can't. Really amazon app sucks. As a prime paying member I am very disappointed."
2,App is OK but better pay via website (in UAE). App often fails during the paimemt so you orders may be canceled and you may lose interesting discounts.
3,I don't know what you've done to your more recent updates but you've made searching for the items I'm actually looking for very difficult. Please go back to the more simplified search function you had before that actually worked properly.
1,Amazon sucks now. The app is filled with bootleg/scam products. They took away prime gift cards reload. You can only apply a gift card to a existing order in the desktop site. Shipping used to be two days and now prime shipping usually takes around a week.
4,"Please enable dark mode setting. When I use force dark mode on samsung android phone, the dark mode does not show (at a minimum) some menu icons and also text when typing in the search bar."
1,"Always make sure you receive your refunds. It seems as though I have to call just to get a refund. My package was never delivered. I canceled the delivery since it was already 4 days late. I've yet to receive my money. Since they want to ""boost"" the security verification process, needing to accept a link through an email, it's more troublesome than ever. You used to have to only give the account holders info. But since they've changed that, I have to bug my mother on vacay for access."
4,"Same as ebay plus every type of American stores, always requiring us to pay custom taxes multiple million times before delivery is sent out to residence -Gross- Starting to hate united states cause it's complicated having to fill up many forms and payments when item arrives at country. U can feel my disappointment although i'm merely a customer, not fan of Unamazing Amazon as it's a platform which keeps stealing cash from consumers non-stop! Lack of compassion, can't enjoy buying here easily 😫"
1,Wishlists for friends no longer showing date item added to the list. Now i have to ask people what they want..no more surprises.
3,App tends to crash on me lately in the middle of searching and then I lose what I was looking at. The font is smaller than usual. Stop trying to fix what wasn't broken in the first place.
3,"Hit or Miss functioning. SOMETIMES the app will allow me to pull up my orders, but not usually. I can see about three recent items or order again suggestions but not my actual recent orders. SO frustrating !"
3,"Filters dont always filter. For example selecting 100$ to 209$ sometimes will show you items that are 59$. search results interspersed with sponsored adds that have nothing to do with your search. For example if I search ""backpacks"" I will get many sponsored results for USB sticks and the like. Something is broken here."
1,"The app no longer allowed me to purchase kindle books. I get it, I understand not wanting to give google a split but why then can I no longer swap Kindle unlimited titles either? If I don't have access to a desktop both this and the Kindle app can't fulfil their purpose."
1,Used to have top-notch services but standards plummeted since last year. SG customer service staff accused returns to be used but could not tell me which order as I have video proof that the items I returned are brand new and sealed at the post office. Also does not process refunds even after they cancelled an order 2 weeks ago. Contacted service staff on different occasions. They do not know their job well and many of them are confusing and rude.
1,"Worst customer service ,called them many times because i cancel order and refund not added to my account ,each time the representative said (we will call back and give you the refund reference number) ,but no one is calling back ,this behaviour will affect your reputation and you have to fix these issues"
1,Amazon shopping sucks when it comes to trying to recover an old account they want you to remember the exact last three items you purchased even after giving all the other information to prove it's you they won't validate you as the owner. Then they want to talk to you like your being aggressive and upset when you can't recover your account even after giving all your information correctly.... Amazon you're not my counselor.
2,Please add better support for Android 12L and Samsung Foldable Devices. I just don't understand why you don't just give us access to the Amazon Shopping app for Tablets. That would make more sense and be a better use of the larger Main Display.
3,"Mostly works well, but they mix all their notifications in the default android channel, so you can't turn off ""watch now"" ads without stopping important notifications."
1,"Worst App upgrade ever. In the past selecting the prime service was smooth and easy. Now you can't. Now if you want prime, you need to go on the desktop to select prime. Who carries a desktop pc with them on train or bus. Amazon should sack/fire the idiot who did this update and ruined the App. Oh by the way did you notice that when you are trying to make a purchase, check the url. It take you to a fraudulent website. I would be very careful make a purchase. The App does not look safe at all."
1,The new app is the worse thing I have ever seen The new ad when opening the app and the suggestions for things I don't care about are too much. Guess the money they get from LOTR ads is enough to offset me cancelling prime and moving on.
1,"Previous version was good. The latest version has destroyed the Amazon app. I live in US but also shop for my family in India. When I change the setting to India and try to order something, it shows me the items in my US cart only. It does not show any item selected in Indian cart. Earlier I could toggle easily between US vs India cart, but now it shows only US cart both in US and India Amazon."
1,The app keeps converting from English to Spanish. If I reinstall it will be in English and then convert back to Spanish. Very frustrating!
1,"Love Amazon but not this app. Search protocol provides too many results, too much information is mind boggling. Easier to do Google search then click on Amazon. App is cluttered with promotions. Account info works fairly well."
1,"Not at all as convenient as it used to be. Don't have a complete history of stuff you ordered, wish list constantly freezes every time you try to remove something, no dark mode, etc. But worst of all, is it will straight up refuse to load if you have a VPN active. No joke. So if you're a privacy-minded person just know that Amazon 100% does not support you."
1,"What's wrong with you admin ? I had very bad experienced with this Amazon,my account has automatically disappeared,I bought so many products on cash on delivery,I had some points to redeem and I kept some selected products on carts now I can't find my choosen products and points are gone,this is very wired."
1,This is the worse company ever I tried to get my account transfered over to my new phone but amazon said I couldn't because I didn't have the last phone number I used on my amazon account which is the number I used to open up the account more than 7 yes ago then they asked what my last debt card or credit card was which I used debit for purchasing safety. Who keeps there old cell phone number from 7 years ago and who keeps prepaid debt card numbers? Well Amazon says you should. Also the person
3,"I have been a Prime member for years. I have a suggestion to improve the app. When I am shopping, I like to look at colors of different items next to each other to color coordinate. It is very hard to tell if items match each other. Such as do these multi colored pants go with this shade of red. Or do these outdoor chair cushions match the tablecloth I have picked out. If there was a way to drag the item in the cart up and down to place them next to each other it would be helpful."
3,"App doesn't separate notifications categories, so I guess they'll all get silenced. No I don't want marketing notifications spam amazon."
1,It defaulted my language to Spanish even though I don't speak Spanish and have never given my phone any indication that i speak Spanish and i have no idea how to change it to English because everything is in Spanish
3,"I ordered items ,then I was informed they were not deliverable. Ordered on another address and my account hasn't been corrected yet."
1,"Notification spam, Nov 2022. Pay for prime? Spend tens of thousands of dollars on Amazon per year? Too bad, your getting push notification spam and you'll like it! That's how Amazon treats their customers. Don't believe me, install their app and find out."
1,"4th time without me cancelled my order. they assured me that the courier could not get through.they sent from the head office promised delivery at a certain time.dosiavka ge came to my question where the order was answered that the delivery was before 9 pm, while in the application my order was canceled again, that I allegedly did not pick it up.also, after placing an order, without notifying by e-mail, or sending a message to the phone, they wrote in the message that sorry, there was a problem"
1,"Amazon is the absolute worst. Most recent experience, the delivery for items ordered was delayed, then the items were canceled after the rep stated they would be delivered next day. Cs was extremely rude when I contacted them again regarding this issue and said my refund was processing. I wanted the items, didn't ask for order to be canceled nor a refund. Do better Amazon. And I will NEVER make the mistake of shopping with you again."
3,"The pop-ups on start up is annoying and livestream thing is a terrible idea, never has anything im remotely interested in and when I try to scroll past, it opens it up full screen"
1,"I've had this app for several years. It recently updated but in Spanish (which I don't know). I have no idea how to change it back to English and until it does, I won't use it."
4,Please add dark mode. The app is good but would be great with dark mode. Almost every major brand has some variation of dark mode however it's 2022 and Amazon a 1.2 Trillion dollar company has yet to implement it.
1,I love everything about Amazon! However the app will not give me the option of Kohls any longer to return items. I loved the convenience of that. Please bring it back! Not sure why this has changed recently
1,I had moved recently and updated my shipping address when i had ordered something it reverted to my old address and i cant dispute the package or even tell them they had the wrong address in their support sometimes these things need simple resolutions with having to jump through hoop after hoop.
1,"Does not allow me use a bluetooth locker, asks to turn on location that's already on. Uninstalled and reinstalled app and it still doesn't know the location is on. Now I have 2 packages that will be returned because I can’t pick them up. Customer Service knows about this problem. What's the hold up with fixing this bug?"
2,I never had a problem with the this but now I do. I tried to order a few things and it won't let me use my giftcards. I do not want to add my credit card or anything like that. I can't tell if this is a glitch or not. Other then that it's a good way to shop and you do get free shipping without prime
1,"They put my account on hold for their own mistakes in charging. Honestly, they keep on making me rethink having a Prime account altogether. I will probably not renew it for next year."
3,"Disbaling the ability to purchase Kindle books through the app is a horrible design change. As a user, I don't want to waste my time logging into Amazon from a web browser just to buy a an ebook. More steps to purchase means I'm going to purchase less books. Hopefully whatever issue Google has with this feature can be resolved because it's not in the best interest of the consumer."
1,"Randomly using my microphone. Do NOT give it permissions. Generally a good app but I have serious privacy concerns after seeing it use my mic when I was just browsing, not doing anything that should involve my mic. Even Facebook doesn't do this."
2,"So far, not impressed. I only downloaded the app because while on the site, they enticed me with $30 coupons. HOWEVER it's a real bait and switch because the items have to be sold and delivered by Amazon. I also found an item on the app that refused to get in my cart. Check the website and it's nowhere to be found. 2 star only given because at least you can still use your Smile account on the app. You just have to select it. I always have Transfiguring Adoption as my charity."
1,Incredibly slow to load. Most of the time it just locks up on a blank white screen. Crashes Kindle. Very small font used makes it extremely difficult to read about items. Current version has taken to adding Shortcuts which cannot be removed. They're not my shortcuts but what Amazon thinks I want to look at. Developer needs to add option to remove/change these unrequested shortcuts. Needs a major rethink.
1,"Customer service is never helpful. They always try to stand on the company's side, as if Amazon is not responsible for anything. Definitely searching for alternative, the service on Amazon is becoming horrible!"
2,"Ok so I bought an item on Saturday and paid for it to come sooner than the expected date, then they message me saying it'll be a day early, didn't happen, Then I check the tracking the next day and it hadn't even been sent out for delivery? Now it's 2 days later and they talking about it should arrive by the 18th I made the purchase on the 12th WOW"
1,"I ordered an expensive laptop a day a week ago. Nothing has changed in the order all this time, they only promised to inform the delivery date. The delivery date was never told to me, I talked with support three times, it did not lead to anything. They could not help me even though they promised. In the end, I gave up on these promises and asked for a refund. This store apparently is not able to do the right thing."
5,I've ordered from Amazon mutiple times and have never been dissatisfied. Also love being able to track my current orders as well as view my past orders
1,"Absolutely awful. So many problems with the webpage/app. Just as bad as ebay's webpage, if not worse. Are they both created/updated by the same people..... Only noticed these issues while trying to sort out a failed delivery, Amazon delivery drivers can be such idiots. Fed up with going round in circles on the app."
1,"Crashes - Intentional Amazon bug that causes a crash and forces you to update the app. Would be better to have simply stated ""update required"". Had this happened to only one app in our househould it would have went unnoticed. Clearing cache and restarting did nothing...hence this was an Intentional bug."
3,As of late everytime I ordered something from Amazon it doesn't reach me by mail it's lost or missing. Beginning to wonder that their staff is stealing my products or US mail not doing a good job. Not a happy camper I would like my products sent to me on time on the day I want it sent. I am a good customer but I am not going still use Amazon if they failing the customer. You guy's need to step up fix whatever you have to fix.
1,I can't say I've ever had a positive experience with this app. The serch engine is NEVER accurate and the app itself is constantly crashing. There's always at least two loading errors whenever i want to use the app. I only use this app because its my only option.
1,"Don't waste your time, freezes when scrolling (on 2 devices) and now lags and crashes when it tries to load ads for prime video (multiple ads per page)."
5,Effortless. Great price. Great product. Unique clothes. No mistakes That's all for now
5,This app is amazing I don't understand why people are talking about ads when there is none overall this app is great for looking for things you need/want :)
2,More and more delivery issues. Product quality is also a problem. Too many returns and now they ruined the music and kindle apps! Hating it ...
1,Getting really tired of vague results that only the very most tenuously match what I'm specifically searching for. On top of that being forced to pay for the premium next day delivery service where the package still doesn't arrive the next day despite being ordered within the time limit.
3,"The app is easy to use but when there is an actual issue, the agents helping you often offer wrong information. Its difficult to know what agent is helping correctly. In my most recent experience the agents made the issue worse. I just don't understand how intentionally offering wrong information is good customer service. To me the quality of the app would be linked to the quality of experience from order to delivery. Unfortunately that experience can vary."
2,"I don't know what update it happened at but this app takes at least a solid minute to do anything. At least on a moto g7. Searching for an item the screen is blank for a long time, then when they all show up and you click on one it takes a long time again. Takes forever to change the page at all. Order history, your better off looking through your email notifications. It wasn't like this a couple months ago"
1,This app use to be so awesome now it just sucks I order stuff in advance and tells me I don't have enough to pay for the items even tho I paid in advance I wish I could keep being a loyal customer but now not so much
1,"Past few updates have made this app increasingly slow. Trying to scroll down through wish list, it stalls and sticks. Worse still, the wish list UI has updated and makes having a list useless. It only shows the new, Amazon price. 1) it uses to say ""32% less than when added"" so you know when the price has fallen... not any more. 2) used items and other sellers prices aren't shown... so, I guess they assume you only buy from one seller, amazon! Very bad update- switch back!!!"
1,Fix the app! I've had issues for months not being able to load the orders screen. I get a picture of a dog telling me there is an error every single time I click it. I thought it was just me but from the other reviews it looks like it's everyone. One of the most profitable companies in the world and the frigin app doesn't work.
4,Been great. Just little problems once in a while. When I brought my new kindle it change the language from English to another language. Can't fine a way to change it back to English
1,"I am irritated with the new update! 20 min later, I still can't find anything. Where are my saved for later items and my purchase history. So irritating that they moved everything and I can't find them."
1,I have 2 accounts. A US and a Canadian acct. It will not now show my US cart. Ridiculous. I think it happened after the last update. Can't Uninstall every time I want to look in it
3,"""We're sorry, please try reloading the page"" Is all I ever see. I've tried restarting my device, doesn't work. Please fix this."
2,Cannot enable Smile on Pixel 6 Pro. It's completely missing from the settings menu. Please fix.
3,What can one say? Amazon is a beast amongst others. It gets the job done. The app is more intuitive than you need. Check out the independent sellers section and the Luxury items section if you want to do it all...
1,Delivery services are bad. Over half my orders have been delivered to the wrong address. It's very embarrassing and inconvenient to have to walk around a complex searching on other people's doorsteps for my items. It also causes neighbors to be uncomfortable like I'm looking to steal or snoop. It's extremely inconvenient to pay the prime membership every month yet have to go hunting for my packages. It's frustrating to have to reorder items and get in contact with Amazon customer service.
2,"Updated 7.6.22: uninstalled/reinstalled app. Still no change. Not sure if my app updated bc it does it automatically but I'm assuming so b/c it suddenly gives no push notifications despite them being on/no settings changes. I order Amazon a lot & always received notifications until June 2nd. The package was not on Prime & I thought maybe that was why, although still strange. Another package showed up & sat 4 hours before I found it yesterday. No notifications. What has happened?? Please fix!"
2,"I can no longer view my orders in the app, it refuses to list them. Even the filter doesn't work any more. **Edit** I still cannot view my orders. What is going on Amazon? Pull your fingers out please."
3,"Why does Amazon shopping app give results for items which aren't available? I'm looking for things to buy, if I can't buy it I'm not interested in seeing it!"
1,New update is a joke been getting adds trying to reach out to support is way harder then it should now things are horribly laid out. And top it off a multi billion dollar company who net profiter over 350billion dollars from COVID in one year is now pushing ads in the app. Lately I've been getting a lord of the ring add on launch
1,The order page has been broken since latest update. Continuous loading loop. Please fix major bug.
1,"Bro just give me my damn stuff I'm not asking for a lot damn just give it, like when I buy something, I expect to get it on the day it says it's going to be delivered on,and i don't want to come back to the app just to find that I have to revise my payment method because there was an """"error"""" and then next thing you know it adds another day until it's delivered to me. Like just give it, I do t want it to add another day of misery. G.I.V.E.M.E.M.Y.D.A.M.N.S.T.U.F.F.B.I.T.C.H"
3,"Settings Broken, Machine Learning Bizarrely Bad No matter how many times I set my language and currency preferences, they always revert to what I don't want. It's a minor gripe that becomes frustrating over time. The algorithm is surprisingly bad, constantly recommending women's clothing when I have never shown any interest in that class of products."
5,"App is much better now. No problems as in past experiences. Only I believe there is a glitch in the app because I will get an offer of a coupon to save on an item and leave the page/app for a while and upon returning the offer is no longer there and the price is higher I clear my cache and go back to shopping and voila, it's back."
1,"I love shopping with Amazon because there's almost nothing you can't find, but youguys have got to fix the bugs in your app, PLEASE. The last few purchases I attempted to make had to be canceled bcuz Amazon kept sending alerts for me to update my payment information when there's no need to. The card information is up to date and there was more than enough on the card for what I wanted to purchase. This isn't just happening to me. Fix it Amazon"
2,"The app is great, let you do what they think you want, but there is a problem the is annoying me. If I'm searching for something but I need to look for the proper name outside the app, I lost everything. I have to start all over again. Why can't you leave the app and get back exactly where you were???"
2,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP The feature that lets you see past and in-process purchases is broken. All you see is a blank screen or error message. Search function always 'finds' items—even when none of those found match your search terms. Customer service contacts keep getting harder to find. Meanwhile, they keep 'updating' the app with new ways to try to get you to buy more things you dont want. This app shows the customer is clearly NOT the priority"
1,"I love Amazon but,,, I am extremely frustrated with asking for a specific search and getting a whole ton of product that I'm not interested in. It's a huge waste of my time. It is aggravating to all get out. They have the ability to give you what you're looking for. But they choose not to. Don't get me wrong I use Amazon and buy a lot of stuff there. However this is ridiculous. Amazon just give me the search I asked for please!"
3,"Been a Amazon shopper for 7years I spent close to $40,000 and never had a problem getting my packages big or small . Now lately I'm starting to recieve poor customer service my bf let me use his account n I paid for everything, they put his account on hold took my money out the bank n will not release my merchandise. I'm confused really . Now I can't access his account to again upload my debit information. I'm at my wit's end n really need prayer. I depend on Amazon I don't have a car"
3,"App is easy to use and well put together but the service itself is poor. For the last few years ordering a product on Amazon is a roll of the dice. Often ""new"" products will come clearly used and missing packaging, Amazon will not allow you to give these sellers poor reviews and does not offer replacement items, just money back, which is irritating. Refurbished tech is especially problematic, most of the time you will not receive what you ordered. Only order simple items from this app."
1,"Awful. Since update it lags, ful of annoying bugs. And why can't I track drivers anymore."
1,"The Luna ""Touch"" on screen control needs fixed or a settings option because it doesn't work well for any games"
1,I am seriously disappointed. Been waiting here for order. No call was made no attempt was made and your carrier fools us both. Also you state to please contact my carrier??? How tf you expect me to do that when I have no contact details nor is your app very supportive on this matter
1,"What a pain! I just wanted to get my locker items not download a huge app in an area with bad service, wait outside because I don't get service in the store. Go through allowing a bunch of permissions I don't want to give it."
2,"This app has never let me down in terms of usefulness. However, as of the most recent update (06/20/22) it is frequently giving me error screens (you know, the ones with the dogs). It at first was just with my orders screen but now it is with most of the app sans a few screens. As I said at first, the app had been incredibly useful, but has recently gotten unusable."
1,"same issue happening with the prime app , I bought an item through the shopping app and then subscribed to the prime video in order to watch the new season of the boys , now it has declined my last order through shopping and locked me out of both accounts , it gives you an option to switch countries telling you that might solve the issue but it doesn't do anything , it just loads for a second and gives you the option again ,you tried to contact customer service? You need to be logged in... BS"
1,Too bright needs dark mode. Always opens app from website. Super annoying. If I wanted to open the app I would have.
1,"Amazon prime and Amazon are going downhill. They can't fulfill orders correctly, my account keeps getting messed up by Amazon."
4,"Amazon is the lick.. this place/website for shopping comes in handy all the time!! An everything store, really. The updates take lots of mb tho."
2,"I loved the app until about a month ago. At that time, and since, all I get are errors saying I cannot log in due to authentication. I've tried reinstalling to no avail. It's really annoying because I used to use it all the time. Any idea what the issue is? I only just added double authentication in hopes of fixing the issue, but no"
1,"from 2 stars to 1, now that i can't even open 2 out 4 tabs (to find my list of addresses). absolutely the worst app i have in my phone. this app is such a slow, janky 1980's POS. takes forever just to even load some pics that then take forever to swipe. so much for saving time shopping from home, i could've driven to the store and back before amazon's app could even load the damn reviews! get it together, king of online retail! 😨"
3,"Language is key for finding stuff. And I find it frustrating that the app has none. I need to disable the app, eneble and update it once in a while because it keeps changing from english to french. I did not ask for that. I did not change it to french. IDGAF about Quebec's provical law about engilsh or french. My personal preferences and personal... for the bilions Amazon is worth, I think having language preferrences available in app something easy to do, it's a minimum, you own to your users."
2,"Your price filter is a joke. 'Price: low to high' omits low price items that are in the standard search. And why do you refuse to employ low to high... PLUS P&P? Many items are a token price like 10p, yet P&P is a hundred times that figure."
2,"Lately I've been having a ton of issues with Amazon charging me randomly for stuff I'm not subscribing too, and then having to jump through hoops just to get a refund, and then them constantly delivering my packages to the wrong address when I've put in detail what my front door looks like but they get to my apartment building (only 4 apartments, 2 buildings) and they still just toss it on the first porch they see."
2,"when I wanna log in it just doesn't work at all,like it says I didn't order stuff and so on , and when I logged out, I couldn't even open the app amymore"
4,"It's a mixed experience. I buy things that are inexpensive items and they work great and operate correctly. Then you can buy something expensive and it doesn't work brand new out of the box because they didn't want to give you all or the best parts. I'm amazed, surprised, and appreciative, of inexpensive items. It's a mixed experience. Their refund policy saves the buyer from a nightmare. However."
3,Searching for an item is ridiculous! You can ask for Something specific and you get things that are Completely unrelated to your search!
3,"Would like to see fingerprint login option, don't like idea of being logged in all the time."
1,"Not a great update, lost searching for similar sellers and different prices, the searches are just odd now and nowhere near as specific. There's no way to sign up to Amazon prime in the app? You have to visit the website (which kinda makes the app pointless) I don't know what you've done but it runs super slow now as well."
1,The app used to work perfectly but now I face lags and overuse of data on a daily basis. My main issue is that I cannot see my orders. I try to open that tab and it keeps loading for hours. I only manage to open it properly once a week. The app is good to browse items however they really need to improve the after sales UI issues.
5,"It's good to find whatever you want. Very good quality. You can even choose the color , price , size , brand etc... It's a very useful app. The delivery is very fast. There is very good offer. Sometimes there is some days where they put free delivery or fast delivery. I highly recommend Amazon. It is very easy to order. You can pay cash or card. When I order something it's the same as the pictures. I love Amazon.♥"
1,"Growing tired of searching for products and Amazon throwing everything under the sun except for the product I'm looking for, because they're advertising it. I've started going to Google and buying it from other sites because I'm tired of looking for a product and getting EVERYTHING but that product in my search results. Plus Amazon claims prime delivery in a day or two and it never comes on time. They're just as unreliable as any other source."
1,"Used to be good. Now it's slow, half the time will have problems adding merchandise to cart. Half the time I get error message indicating something went wrong with accessing the content. I have stopped purchasing allitbof items, just give up after such time waste and purchase fro Walmart or at another site. I uninstalled and installed again. Did nit help."
1,Amazon used to be really awesome! That means it's not anymore. If you don't attach your personal account to them they don't care about you or your orders. They hired their own drivers which means the regular drivers that are driving their personal vehicles dont care if they deliver your packages or not. My biggest complaint is that they won't let you post a review on any item if they don't have your bank account info. That is beyond pathetic! Absolutely disgusted with Amazon these days.
1,The quick settings menu is now a mess. I cannot change country on the fly at all now. I regularly shop from both the UK and the US sites but the app doesn't provide a way to easily switch the country now. What a poor choice of reworking that menu into something less useful.
3,"Please move the save for later items to a tab by itself and make it searchable. Move the Alexa button, it's annoying."
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRANSACTIONS PAGE? WHY I CANNOT SEE MY OAYMWNTS & TRANSACTIONS? I TRIED CALLING/TEXTING CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT NO ONE AT AMAZON SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. I GOT NEW PHONE & STILL SAME ISSUE. PLEASE FIX THESE AMAZON.
2,The app keeps crashing all the time I tried changing to my preferred currency. It is only stuck in US dollars.
2,"Fyi, no one wants to see an ad shoved down their throat every time the app is opened. That's trash; and I am a huge LOTR fan. App itself is outdated. No dark mode. Search results show many irrelevant items, and always promote paid items, even if they are unrelated or badly reviewed. Ads galore, and the privacy invasion is horrid."
1,Get with the times and offer a dark mode. I can't be the only one tired of burning their eyeballs out while online shopping in the bed at night...smh. UPDATE: Two years have passed since initial review and still no dark mode. Seriously?
5,"It was great, the items were what I needed. I would like to see some jewelry, gold and jem rings."
4,"With the new price rise, from €3,99 to €4,99 a month, I hope to see improvements on both: movies, tv, series; as well as in music. Now if you want to listen to your favourite music you'll have to pay extra. I'm not stupid neither, last week I was listening to some music from 2020,I actually did a compilation and listen to it for the whole week. On monday, the same songs I had been playing for free, they weren't free anymore.They now make songs distinction. Coincidentally those exact songs i like"
3,"app has UI glictches, and is slower then the browser app, sometimes. also would be helpful if the items I requested to return would show in a separate tab on Orders view. I go there frequently to see the deadline for returns. Wish there was a link to gift card balance after return is complete so i can verify the refund was issued indeed."
1,What is wrong with this app? It keeps freezing. It is also a huge deal to just go to the app in a phone browser.
3,Update with availability to tap/hold icon to see orders is faster than trying to see in app at least (takes WAY too long). Would REALLY like the option to filter by a certain price; Example: Under $15. NOT Amazon default prices. Also option to filter by material please! Prime increase is ridiculous with slower delivery ETA. Fix the app issues please.
1,I use Amazon regularly. But the app has been changed from account to some random guys name and email. I can't log him out or switch accounts. The phone won't Uninstall the app only disable it. From a computer my account is accessible. Tried customer service and I got disconnected while the agent was trying to help me.
5,Its a great platform for online purchases. I had an issue with one of my orders its originality was completely different than described on Amazon review section. Than i applied for refund. I am really impressed by Amazon services that they returned my amount without taking back the delivered order. Really impressed. I will surely recommend it to my circle.
1,They are getting worse than other sellers. They send you the wrong item and then want to penalize you for returning it. They are now my last choice for online shopping. The app updates have made it difficult to navigate. You used to be able to view previous support conversations and now most of them are not there.
1,What's happened to Amazon app. It's useless now. Can't check orders it just continues to keep trying to bring up account without success. Yes it may have wishlists but you can't access. Won't be ordering anything else from Amazon until it's fixed. Can't check on returns or refunds. Terrible app.
2,"You can no longer cancel subscriptions through the app, which means you have to drag out a laptop every time you want to cancel anything, because the phone gets redirected to the app any time you open Amazon on the web. Not worth it anymore, at all."
1,I moved to Mexico and need my app in English but deliveries to my Mexican address. The chat option was useless. They pointed me to the settings page which does not offer the choice I need. Then they sent me a customer service link that just goes to a Spanish page with a dozen choices. Useless to me. Very frustrating. I can't be the only English person in Mexico that wants to order on Amazon.
2,Loved the app. Hate the way the prioritize your orders. Used to be able to go orders and it separated what was schedule to be delivered and what had been delivered. Now they are all together and you have to go search for items that kay have longer delivery date. It is terrible and makes no sense to change something like that. Please separate upcoming deliveries and items that have already arrived
2,"I would rather use the mobile website through browser as this app provides less functionality and has weird UI behavior in some areas. I mainly use it for the push notifications. FYI, I can't see my entire saved cart, can't move to lists from cart, and navigation has some odd and frankly undesirable behavior in paging backwards. Could ya's actually pay a decent offering to a decent app/site designer for a logical functioning and better app that doesn't truncate the main site functionality?"
3,"It's really irritating that Amazon is taking over more and more of the users screen space with their own promotions. The last few weeks it's been taken over by links to videos of product shows and now the whole page is almost solely ""Lord of the Rings"". I just want to get straight to products. NO SALES PITCHES."
1,"I opened the app, and have a full screen video add for the new LOTR show. After that my screen, and the next 5 panels scrolling down, were adverts for the LOTR show on different amazon products. Only then did the buttons appear so I could check my orders. Terrible design UI, irrelevant ads, poor user experience"
1,Loads of issues all of a sudden. I buy from the different Amazon's which you could swap to easily on the app. All of a sudden it locks to the UK basket so a blu ray i put in the Italian basket disappeared even though at the bottom off my scream in the Italian app it showed as being there. I went to the German app to see if it was the same and it was. Tried to chat but there only advise was to contact Amazon Italy and was given a link. Guess i will uninstall and use web version.
1,It's getting very annoying that is paying video advertisements when opening the application. And there is no way to disable that. I am paying for prime and again customers are forced to watch advertisements. I don't mind seeing sponsored results in search.
1,"Amazon app for android is useless. I'm shocked a billion dollar company just neglected for the android. When you click on my orders, the page keeps on loading and gives an error. This has been going on since 4 months, thought they would sort it out still getting an error. Need to use google Chrome to see the purchase hidtory. Really, annoyed"
3,"Happy to extend the Smile option to mobile purchases! EDIT: Taking off 2 stars due to the app freezing & automatically refreshing while attempting to take photos for a review. Should've known better than to write the review first. If this ""feature"" is improved I'll add a star back, but I can't get back all the time wasted struggling with this app."
2,"I have nothing bad to say about this app until the release of the 'Lord of the Ring: The Rings of Power' show, but now everytime I load the app they are forcing an advertisement for the show. Displaying it once, or a few times a week would be okay, but every single time I load the app is a bit excessive."
1,"I don't know what happened, just one day I got a notification saying a payment didn't go thru , and i opened it confused, cuz that payment had already gone thru. And it showed me that error page that refreshes with cute dogs. It hasn't worked since, I even removed and then reinstalled and then updated the app. It just stopped working. :("
1,Recently started spamming annoying ads on startup. I have no interest in whatever lord of the rings stuff is coming out and every time I open the app it shows me this annoying clip. I just want to see the status of my order. Why do companies insist on putting spam into their apps.
1,App just ok. But search terrible and so many errors its constantly switching to another dog sayings opps error on our end. How about diverting a few dollars from trips into almost-space and hire some decent IT people who know what they're doing. Updating to note that Amazon app developers have done nothing at all to fix the many bugs in this app.
1,"The changes Made to the app is making the experience very frustrating the app is getting worse with every update bug are not getting fix and glitches and crashes every time making the app unstable and is very frustrating because we pay for a subscription every month to have a better functional app experience but this is not being deliver. I am very disappointed, I used to love this app but not anymore because this issue and the way they is being handled this problem not resolved"
2,"Word of advice Amazon. Full screen ads are more annoying and make people less likely to click on them. If and when I decide I want to watch Rings of Power, I will. But I'll do that through Prime Video. All I usually want to do on the shopping app is buy something or check my orders"
1,"Promotions are very confusing and time wasting. They gave a promotion for first 3 orders on fresh. If you already had 3 then you can't use it but I'm fine with that... I only had 1 so I placed another with it and it worked. I could've placed another but then they change/ disable that promotion code and give new code only for the first 2 orders. I contact their support, 2 people waste my time and the third just says sorry and says there's no more promotion."
2,"Shipping taking longer,prime becoming less relevant,seriously considering canceling prime. Now it takes 3 days before item ship,I regularly get items from eBay before Amazon even sends. Only real reason I still use it is because I paid for it. Ebay is free,faster shipping,and actually has more product, think the review says it all......."
1,"The company overall has gotten worse over time. Recently made a purchase of items amd some were for my financial state of being. Keeping it short, arrival dates changed alot. Didnt get the 2 day shipping on some items i paid for. Actually lost money and time from set appointments prior based off their word of arrival of some of my items and nothing is or feels made right by it."
2,"App opens but takes a minute to complete load up... Keeps cutting in and out, jumping back to the home page during typing and searching... It started doing this right after the update was installed... So obviously something is not right... need a glitch fix..."
1,"I enjoy Amazon but... the ""app"" itself is soooooo slow and constantly freezes. It's awful!!!! I can't shop on Amazon without going through my browser. I'm uninstalling the app for a while in hope's that they fix these issues. As of now the app is just taking up useless space in my device."
1,Started showing adverts for Prime Video programmes when I open it. There's already enough adverts on everything. It's bad enough they show adverts on a paid for premium service like Prime Video it literally is showing me adverts when I try to watch something on Prime and now the shopping app opens to an advert for TLotR. Not to mention next day delivery seems to have changed to next day dispatch. Amazon are slowly getting worse and worse for wasting time and giving less for your money.
1,"When I open a store app, I expect to be able to see the home page, not a full screen ad for a movie I'm not interested in that I can't close and when I hit the back button, I don't want the app to close. Really terrible idea, Amazon."
3,"Used to be 5 stars but now we can't buy kindle books on the Amazon or Kindle apps due to ""compliance issues"". Maybe it's petty of me but yes, it is a pain to close the app and go to an entirely separate website to purchase an ebook. This negates the ease of purchasing amazon ebooks which is the biggest draw of using Kindle. Instead of making it difficult for consumers, fix the issue which prevents compliance! I will be sure to post the same negative review for Kindle app as well."
3,"Normally I love this app. It's been great for shopping, and I used to be able to track my order when it was within 10 stops of my home. Now I can no longer track my orders. The last two orders I got gave me a warning notification that my order was within 10 stops. And then when the package was delivered. But when I use the app to try an track my package there's no link like there used to be. It's a shame because without the ability to track my order by phone. I don't really need the app."
1,"The app keeps switching to Spanish. I have a few apps that are add supported and play commercials. Amazon is one of those commercials. Maybe because I live near the border, Amazon alternates between playing the commercials in English and Spanish. If I accidentally click on the ad when it's playing in Spanish, it opens up the Amazon shopping app and changes the language to Spanish. Then I have to spend three minutes trying to figure out how to switch it back to English using spanish menus."
1,"It is a forced app that I won't use, Amazon gives awful customer service, and I won't order from them. Yet I am forced to keep this app. I tried uninstalling it and it remained on my phone and in my google play list... Talk about bad practices and tyranny. Annoyed and frustrated doesn't even cover it."
5,"I like this app better than joyful shopping. I get everything on time and with joyful shopping I have to wait almost a month before I get my packages. In the witchcraft supply kit everything is there, but the only problem was the box was damaged a little bit. I gave you a good review and now I'm going to take it back because my package wasn't delivered on the 21"
2,"I'm really annoyed that making changes to your wish lists or shopping lists causes serious lags or crashing. Other than that yeah it's great. Also, their employees don't get paid enough. Thought I'd put that out there."
1,"I completed the most recent update, I can't access anything on the site. I tried to remove the app, unavailable on my phone except to remove updates. I tried to reset the app by removing the updates and it would not work either. I once again updated the app in the playstore and nothing has changed. I can't use the app at all!! Help!!"
2,"Frustrating! For months now I cannot look at my orders in the app. It just loads and blinks every time, no matter what I click on to try to view orders. Very frustrating. Update 9/2/22 there have been a couple updates since I left this review and it is STILL happening."
1,"A full screen ad for a lord of the rings thing every time I open the app, then I hit the back button to hopefully close the ad, and it closes the app. So then I have to open the app again just to be greeted by the same thing all over again."
2,Works fine but blocks speech to text somehow. Really annoying that I can't use speech to text in this app. It's probably because they want you to use Alexa. Which is lame because I want to use the app that I like. No other app on my phone has this problem. Been happening for years. No response from support.
2,"My account was locked for an unknown reason. Customer Support only tells me that I have to wait for a certain email, that just doesn't come. And all of it is happening in the middle of moving to another home when I need to order lots of stuff. I used to trust Amazon, but not anymore ("
1,"The old app used to work well. This one is slooooooow, doesn't show history, and the overall experience makes me either have to a different seller or have to a computer. Overall it is not usable, and probably worthless."
1,"Don't download! You pay a monthly fee for Promised 2 day shipping and it takes 5-7 before they process your order then it ships in 2 days. So it takes a week or more to get your items! It used to be next day or 2 days to get your items, not true any more! Your better off ordering from Walmart you get your items in 3 days there."
1,"Due to Amazon's ridiculous vetting process to Simply log in and perform a normal task. The application itself is pretty well useless. If you do try to use it it's buggy, again has no links to things as simple as performing a refund and again almost impossible to log into because of their protocols."
3,"I prefered the old version with the hamburger menu at the top left. In the new version, to see your orders, you have to click on the bottom, then go to top, cumbersome. 99 times out of 100 I want to search or see my orders. Put the Whole Foods and Pharmacy links on the bottom instead."
2,"Works, but it's very slow to get started - I think it's downloading as many irrelevant ads as possible before letting you use it. It's lucky to get two stars as it has the same pathetic excuse for a search engine as the website."
1,"Amazon has a massive variety of products and the shipping time is convenient. The absolutely terrible support, though, voids any positives. If you ever have to contact support, calling is your best bet. Chat has about a 75% chance of being someone who could care less. Don't even bother with email. Of over 50 emails, I have not had a single one where I did not receive a canned response in which none of my questions or concerns were addressed. Don't even try returns... Nightmare."
1,Package got delayed for a few days and me requesting a refund. I have to wait 3-5 days to get my money returned. Stuff like this set people back especially on projects with small time frames. I demand better system be put in place in case of situations like these. fast forward 9/1/2022 placed another order paid extra for the next day delivery. Went to bed only to see my item price charged and I'm being charged extra for taxes and shipping. Now my item is delayed another day. Stole $7.61 as well
1,"Every search shows different results too. Apparently I posted against the ""guidelines"". Disappointed I wasted all my time reviewing stuff yet to just get deleted. I do post within the guidelines yet I can't post! Yet they want my opinion for other things. Some things get delivered yet doesn't show up as Delivered so I can't return it. Some prices go down AFTER I purchase something."
1,"Screw off with your god forbidden LORD OF THE RINGS ADS. Sure, lord of the rings was pretty good, but whether or not people give a damn about watching your rendition of it STOP WITH YOUR INTRUSIVE ADS — ESPECIALLY THE ONE THAT AUTOPLAYS EVERY DAMN TIME YOU OPEN THE APP. Jesus christ. Also the fact that I can't even begin to ""shop"" on your app without scrolling through FOUR OR MORE ADS is damn ridiculous."
2,"Just spent 50 minutes trying to buy an ebook for kindle. Can't buy it via kindle. Have to buy it via amazon.co.uk/ebooks. No matter how much I tried, I cannot buy this book! I ended up buying £5 gift credit -which I can't use. Then I tried to purchase the book through sending it via email with a link. Obviously that didn't work either. It seems that unless I sign up to 'kindle unlimited' at 7.99 a month, I cannot buy books! What an absolute rip off! Very disappointed in this turn of charges."
2,"So the ads begin... I opened this app to track an order. Not be advertised your garbage lord of the rings show. If this becomes a regular occurrence, I'll delete the app and shop on a computer. Which probably means less money/sales overall."
5,"Amazon is extremely useful to me, I'm so busy that shopping on Amazon and having things delivered works out better than trying to run to the stores sometimes. I've never had a bad delivery so far and I've ordered dozens of things."
2,"Totally agree with the others on the recent update. Lost all my wish lists 🙄 , not only that the search is horrible. I tried looking for a pair of pants for a costume and found absolutely nothing. I had things in my cart........gone now. Again my lists, all of them disappeared."
2,"Customer service is absolutely horrible, make sure you screen shot and conversing you have with them even after that though they're so large they don't care about any customers or the mistakes they make as a company If you have alternative options use them first every time!"
1,I can find anything I want. It just won't be what I want. I gotta scour the reviews and find the worst ones to know what I'm getting if I buy something and even when it seems like it's a decent product... nope it's trash that I gotta send back and jump risk not getting my money back because Amazon likes to sell trash like it's gold and support companies that also sell trash like its gold. Uninstall.
1,Let us turn off automatic videos. It wastes data and makes pages take longer to load
1,"I have not been able to go to home inorder to get information on customer services, because my orders are not being delivered in a timely manner and sometimes not at all. I have never encountered such terrible delivery service and especially since you are paying for it through their Prime program. It is my worst nightmare since I can't get this delivery problem straight with Amazon going on 1 1/2 years now. I now do most of my shopping with Walmart never had a delivery problem with them."
1,After the new update I am not able to log out .why... I TRIED TO FIGURE IT OUT.i would like this feature back.if it's not back I will consider canceling my membership.
1,Recently enabled microphone permissions / Alexa search by default. Disabling still leaves the Alexa icon taking up screen space.
1,"New and used prices showing on the list has been removed. This makes it very difficult to compare items on created lists at a glance, which I really have come to rely on making decisions. You have made it infinitely more difficult to find exactly what I need on my budget. I can't keep using Amazon if this isn't fixed."
1,"Won't let you add smile to the app. It says you can do it but you need to turn on notifications. Go through to that screen as instructed, already have notifications enabled so just says error every time. Feel like they want to look like they help charities but actually make it as hard as possible for you to do so."
2,"More of a problem with logistics, they tell you a shipping date and drive the package through your city to another state and give it to USPS. Seems to happen for items under $20. Those lower cost items are the most important. Headlights to me are a safety issue and are very important. You get no satisfaction on the phone with them you get to talk to a foreigner and the call has no positive outcome. I'm a prime member time to reevaluate my membership or use eBay for more accurate delivery times."
4,"I've had few bad experiences where packages never got delivered and I was never refunded (maybe it was the company). Outside of that, I have had great experiences. what helps is investing in amazon prime, delivery has been great and quick. some delivery drivers delivered damaged packages, but products were in good condition. oh! also, amazon prime has other perks that are amazing. amazon shopping, with or without prime, is easy to figure out."
1,"Worst customer service ever! I just moved to an apartment that has an amazon hub, I have placed four orders and each time they did not provide a locker code. Each time I contacted support and had to jump through hoops each step of the way. The third time they assured me the issue would be fixed and it wasn't fourth time, the agent told me to get back to them when I was near the hub. I promptly asked for a refund and they just lost a customer."
1,"Forced to update to this garbage version just now. Old version (which worked very well overall) stopped working and only displayed an upgrade page. New version has no discernible menu taxonomy, things are buried and tough to find if they are still there at all. Features reduced, removed and dumbed down. Took me 10 minutes skip a subscription this month. See other 1-2 star reviews for more. Will delete this and force myself to use the web browser, so I'll save a ton by not buying anything."
1,"Dishonest company , she stole me did the canselamento of prime subscription, and is still discounting my account ! And the worst there is no communication channel in the app!"
3,"Why can't I buy albums from the app anymore? If you're gonna force me into the music app, at least let me sample/buy from it... the music app sucks and just starts a ""radio"" station. Now I gotta use work-arounds, and I still end up with 5 extra steps to buy new albums. Also, downloading music to my phone puts it in some phantom folder in my phone, unable to be accessed by any other app I like to use. I bought the music, let me use it."
1,"This review won't mean much because it won't stop Amazon from making billions. I won't be using Amazon anymore because they stole my money. I used Prime free trial, and purposely added an expired card in my settings for the renewal, and I kinda forgot about it. They got ahold of my active card somehow, charged me, and I immediately contacted support and was refused a refund when I didn't use any prime benefits and hadn't had it for more than a few hours. I won't support a business that thieves."
1,"Asked if i want to try prime every time i open the app. When i finally decide sure theres a few shows i want to watch, i get a message - can't be done in the mobile app. The general point of mobile apps it to make it easier for users to do eveything all in one spot, not make it so they have to use multiple platforms to do one task. Thank you amazon, I was going to impulse-buy your overly-expensive subscription service, but you stopped me and gave me time to think twice."
5,I could not live without Amazon! Everything at your fingertips and delivered ridiculously fast. I have received items the same day the order was placed. They have also followed through with their guarantee; making good on a transaction that went wrong. Hassle free and treated with respect. Shopping has definitely changed for the better. Thank you Amazon.
2,"The app seems to work fine, however, Amazon has been attempting to steal funds from my prepaid card for over a week. Having contacted them regarding this issue and requesting confirmation that there were no pending charges, I applied funds to my card in an attempt to make a payment to another merchant but Amazon instantly made withdrew MY money. When contacted, after informing me that my account was hacked (it wasn't), my issue was ""escalated"" & I am now playing the waiting game for assistance"
1,New update! The most recent update for this app is terrible. It no longer shows your wish lists on the app and trying to find your way through these new menus are terrible. If you can a previous version of the app I highly recommend that instead.
1,"After being forced to update the app to actually be allowed(!) to use it. I did, only to find to my horror that all of my 20 year history, address details, suggested items, wish list and much more have disappeared. What have you done Amazon?? Please revert to the previous version while you correct this major issue, and please please ensure it works before you release it again. I feel lost. After reading the most recent reviews I see I'm by no means alone. What are you doing? Get it fixed ASAP!"
1,"This is how it is right now; >Try to login >Need 2fa login >Sends text to old number >Can't change number on app, tells me to change in account on browser >Need 2fa >Says recover >Do recover >Get sent back to 2fa 😂 Paying your programmers? Yeah delete this one go on. No swearsies this time. Wouldn't want to be too honest."
5,"I love Amazon. If you're on food share, you get a discount and I only pay $6.99 a month for Amazon Prime, it used to be $5.99 but with the price increases, going up, they had to charge an extra dollar but I still get about half off due to being on food share. I get access to Amazon Prime Video, free shipping, their customer service is great and for confusion, they gave me a refund for Amazon Prime and the AMC subscription I have, which was exactly $16.50 USD. I highly recommend them."
1,"Keeps wiping my basket and saying I haven't viewed anything recently, so it's difficult to find the same items again."
1,"This app has been updated twice, and more issues keep coming. Can't even see my orders cause it keeps refreshing"
1,"The UI is super annoying to navigate, it takes forever just to find some information for certain very specific things. It's super inconvient as well, since everything is sorted super weridky under what should be your account settings. When purchasing, it takes you through multiple screens before you can even see what you're buying; and if you dare open the app from a browser, it refuses to show you your data, causing you to uninstall reinstall. Very poor design."
3,"Good for shopping but looting people by prime subscription. This has to be raised at higher legal levels. I have seen multiple time they renew prime membership without my consent, however if u got to notice that and complain, they will refund. Shopping wise good app and u can save money in various items. For UK, if you don't want to pay for delivery, get item in nearest drop location."
1,"So frustrating to use, copy the exact name of a product then put it into the Amazon search bar and it won't even be on the first page of results. I'd buy alot more if I could actually veiw the item I'm looking for. Also the option to add an item to wishlist just disappears? Like there isn't a button for it half the time, very frustrating. I can't find any place to report this problem in the app or anywhere really. For a multimillion dollar company you'd think the app would be usable at veryleast"
1,Amazon Keeps charging me extra for the memory. No discount on the membership with EBT until after a year passes. Canceled my membership and im still gutting charged. I don't recommend the Amazon app. 10 years ago it was great but this is just ridiculous.
1,Was already using this app less and less due to its sluggishness and long loading times. Now with the new update wont work at all. Thats final for me. Bye bye Amazon. You wont be missed. Ebay is still the same as always. Meaning its fine. Dont fix what aint broken. Someone at amazon actually got paid to screw things up. Nice job.
1,Can't even clear the search box when navigating through various options. It's clears then refills Amy time you navigate elsewhere. Some really basic UI issues with the app that make it very frustrating
1,"Amazon tricks you with the delivery times most of the time, I order something it's because they say it will arrive in a timely fashion, but unfortunately 9/10 times they reschedule the delivery to be a day or two late, making me just want to cancel the order... since they are providing false information in regards to delivery times and days....."
2,"... and now, you are ""forcing"" me to use ""AFFIRM"" payment method by disabling the ""Continue"" button if I don't choose it and if I choose my regular debit card !! Oh c'mon Amazon ! I cannot pay, hence shop anymore !"
1,"I keep trying to use it and it keeps force closing. I've tried updating it, uninstalling and reinstalling. Yall take money from me every month to pay for prime and I can't even use your POS app. 😒👎"
1,"Extremely laggy. Also, I ckicked one link to the Spanish site while looking for products through google, a week ago, and now all my emails and app notifications/recommendations are in Spanish...??! Please help"
2,When making a payment on a new card they shutdown my account because I wasn't able to provide information that I had absolutely no access to. After I had written and provided all details required New update I am unable to search any itmes
1,"The app is useless, just open the website in your browser. Honestly, just get outside and shop locally. I really have nothing positive to say about any aspect of Amazon."
2,TERRIBLE PLACE TO BUY THINGS ONLINE. Products are of a poor quality and often not what you ordered. Deliveries have taken up to 4 weeks or more and product satisfaction is minimal except on the occasions you get what you wanted and in a good time scale...they remove any bad product reviews so that you cant express a negative opinion of what you received and therefore mislead their customers about the products they're gettting
2,The app will not let me in to track my packages. It says I need an update but the only update says install on more devices. I do not need to install or more devices I do need to be able to track the packages that I have already purchased.
2,"Why make all the menus for account n personal bits so annoying, hard to find lists and they're at the bottom of the pile. Why put a big ""buy again"" button there lol if I bought it once I'm good thanks"
1,"This is the worst version of amazon I've ever came across, I've never seen a country heavily dependant on tourism and foreigners so inclosed and not willing to use English, why can't i use English when clearly there is an option for it?"
2,"Clumsy, a mark should show when you have looked at an item. Multiple items in a search should be grouped together."
3,I really really like Amazon but the only thing that I don't like is they should make it easier to get a loan and be able to pay it back little by little like cash app is doing now it should be all about how long and how much you shop and how you use the app by shopping on Amazon or on your account they should get information on how long you've had the app and how long you been shopping and so on
2,First the app.stopped working on my lg..when I got a new samsung 22 still wouldn't perform right..and customer service hunny worse and worse...chat online is horrible ...lost packages independent contractors..so prime delivery becomes standard delivery with a 3 for day wait...next day yeah right..most refunds this year yet ..charge uore and still don't gave5 access to unlimited music and reading ..18.00 more on top of 129.00 for I guess 3 day delivery if u get ur package at all..sad
5,Great app! I got a Nintendo Switch controller and it is awesome! The app made it easy to find what I wanted and for a great price.
5,Works perfect but lately there's a bug on it and it will let me in but once I look something up and try to scroll down it bugs out and kicks me out as well
2,"UI is cumbersome, desperately needs dark mode. Also loads product pages as show at Internet Explorer on a Power Mac G3."
1,Can't reliably see orders in the app. Been a constant problem for a year. Also watch the delivery settings they like to offer paid upgrades that deliver on the same day as free. So many times we could have been over charged for a 'free' delivery. Toxic company in general.
2,The Amazon Smile for charity does not apply with the app. My charity lost donations while I was shopping for a move. I was very disappointed when I discovered this. I know it's not a ton of money but every bit helps
1,Having to update every time you open the app is annoying and then it doesn't update and the same screen keeps popping up. You can't have more than 99 apps open when I only have this one open. What is up with that?
4,"I love my Amaxon app. My saved list is not displaying correctly. It displays in a single line of letters on the first item only. It doesn't get corrected when I uninstall the app, or restart my phone. It does display correctly when I tap on it. Help!!"
1,"It was all good until it changed my whole account profile to french (on the app and browser). It took what felt like a decade to even get the settings to show up despite going to that menu multiple times (restarting did nothing), which means this is a big manual mistake by some idiot. It also doesn't warn you that your prime trial/membership is up like it says it will. Does Bezos pay his people more because of the rise in membership price?? No? Didn't think so. Eat the rich."
5,"All is good. The only thing I wish they would put is something more to interact with when you have bad delivery drivers. For reporting them etc. Like when you have instructions in the app, but they never obey them. And if I'm disabled meaning, there is one door I can get to, the packages need to go to that door. Other wise they sit there until someone can get them for me. And that might not be until the next day. Other than that. The app is great and gets me into a good bit of regular trouble."
1,"Buyer beware-rural people have an insane shipping fee, even with prime. insane I've never had this issue anywhere else.. Returns aren't good for people who literally don't have access to a printer and aren't tech savvy. No loyalty/discounts for regular customers, just TV that you can find free. I also purchased new items that I received *used* (during covid) endless amounts of time...."
1,Haven't been able to view my orders in the app for months. Kind of a key feature that needs to be solved.
2,"Only one (frustrating) irritation... More often that not, I have multiple items in my cart that I'm not ready to checkout. But there is one single item that I'm ready to checkout. This app won't allow me to selectively checkout just one item in my cart! There is a 'Deselect all items' if I'm on my desktop. Why doesn't the mobile app has that? It kills the entire shopping experience. Other than this issue, I've to say this App performs way better than all the big names shopping carts out there."
1,"Older app with the previous icon style was easy and intuitive, this is awful, everything is hard to find, dies sort properly, layout designed by an idiot Already stopped my prime subscription, as I can most cheaper and just as quick from eBay. I rolled back to earlier app, but if they force me to update....then bye bye Amazon and I spend thousands, with multiple accounts at home and work"
1,"Downloaded app trying to get help with my awful kindle experience,,seems amazon would rather waste my time than take my money and actually deliver content or working products"
1,"TRASH UPDATE. Got nagged like crazy to force-update to ver. 24, a definite DOWNGRADE! Lots of loading errors ""Oops its our fault"", SLOW... If it aint broke, dont fix it! 😆 Ver. 20.19 was Great 4.5 stars, Fast, Easy to Navigate the menus at the TOP = Less scrolling, replicated desktop site! Now theyre at the bottom or hidden, they want us to scroll thru a bunch of stuff instead of going directly where we want in 1 click. That = wasting time, LESS $$$ buying AMZ!"
3,"Would have given it 4-5 stars but what's with it? Why has it become so slow despite the limited internet And also, it never gives the exact time you'll receive your order, it's never the exact date mentioned Please fix it, I really love this app, I'm not ready to change it for another"
1,"I've been using this app for long. Very good shopping experience, my wish list, the drug and drop function and everything, indeed a very efficient app, until you guys did, I don't know what! But you are not improving it"
4,The new version is great! But the search filters need work. To make it easier and faster to get better results on a certain product.
4,The app does what it's supposed to and I prefer it over using the website on my phone. I still haven't received the 15€ coupon for my second in-App order though. In Germany there's an offer currently to promote the app.
1,"Amazon is by far the worst online business that i have ever had the displeasure of ordering from. Customer service cant help do anything besides the things you can do yourself. They aren't interested in going above and beyond to make their business secure for shoppers and resolving shopper issues. Amazon is splitting the payments and they say they arent aware of it but isnt doing anything to stop it. $100 order would be split up, $5.84 one day, 26.58 two days later etc amazon is the worst"
3,Not ready for prime time. I'm on top line Samsung with Android 12. Customer videos play sound but no picture. My recommendation: Stick with a browser... this app is half broken.
1,"FIX YOUR SEARCH AREA!! All these ""updates"" yet the searching capabilities increasingly gets worse, annoying/frustrating as hell!! Whoever is in charge for the area in I.T. (whatever it is) fix the search engine for your app! Please and thank you!"
1,This app is terrible... I order 1 thing off of Amazon and now I can't order anything. I already co tasted my bank and they said everything was working. Amazon is too buggy for me. I'm definitely switching apps.
1,Best place for everything. Needs a spot in filters while shopping for EBT SNAP. Really hope they take in consideration. Will consider rating better once there is.
2,"I can never understand why the shipping has changed so much. Why does it take over two weeks for it to at least ship, this wasn't always like this if this is a way for them to not look bad with bad timing it's annoying and ridiculous."
4,Very bad delivery service As soon as I order something expensive and require signature something go wrong n never get delivered I think drivers are stealing the expensive items because they know by the requirement of the signature that there is something expensive n Amazon costumers service they are just telling you whyu want to hear but not doing anything actually...it happened 2 to times to me so is no mistake they hire anyone so this is what happens so why do I pay prime to get it after 4days
2,"Amazon offers paid delivery services even if your a prime member, I never use it because 2 day shipping for free is fine. But approximately 5 of my 8 orders have taken much longer.....I had a prime day purchase on the on the 12th and didn't receive it until the 22nd....I believe the is Amazon's attempt to make prime members pay shipping."
1,Nothing works on the Amazon anymore. Never recommending Amazon again. Bought a high value item with EMI option and Amazon didn't convert the Amount to EMI as systems are not working and asking me to contact the Bank now just before the day I have to clear my CC Bill.
1,"Amazon's India customer service is appalling. Hung up on, and chat disconnected too many time to list... Terrible return service, I had to dispute charges with Chase bank. Amazon lost the returns and made me wait over a month to even look into it!! Nope, not paying for the price hike on the ""Prime"" scam anymore!!!! Goodbye Amazon. You fked up!!! Oh, the apps sucks too, some gay guy is in charge and needs to justify his pathetic job by rearranging everything to make it harder to find things."
5,I love dealing with Amazon. Sometimes my orders are delivered early. I have never had a late order from Amazon. In fact living in a small Saskatchewan town. I do alot of shopping from Amazon. 🙃
3,"I dont know if it has to be with Amazon, but my orders always get stuck in one place and arrives weeks later than the date expected. I order from a bunch of sites and I don't have this problem :("
1,"They keep trying to send me items I didn't buy. Criminals. I already spend a fortune here, customer service can't help, so I guess a nice 1 star review and BBB complaint is the way to go."
1,I just got charged 11.30 for something I didn't order! I ordered a movie and already paid for it! I would like my money back on my card for the item I didn't pay for. I don't have Amazon prime.
1,"Let's start off by saying that Amazon has no reason for not having things ready for delivery at least by 24 hours after you order!!!!!!!! Hey Amazon I ordered things from you on October 19th, 2022. I was wondering why that if I pay for shipping it would have been in the mail and delivered by now. So if it is order on Wednesday October 19th, 2022 you would think they would have had it in the mail already but it has not been shipped yet??? Amazon needs to be looked at by the Better Business Buero!"
2,I ordered a costume for Halloween off of Amazon and they canceled my order without notifying me saying that I denied delivery when I never did. Sometimes it seems more like a scam than it needs to be.
1,"Awful. I wish I could load the image here, the promise of $10 off the 1st two orders. NOPE. it was a lie for me to download the app. I called after ordering, showed em the image, ""to bad, so sad"" 😞"
5,I love how easy it is to order. I wish they had drones in rural areas like they do in big cities but I am so thankful to get packages.within 2-5 days. ordering is simple and fun also great for shopping to family out of state when getting gifts
1,The video keeps stopping. One movie stops at least 10 times. They want you to pay a bunch of money for digital but it does nothing but repeatedly shut down. Waste of money
1,"App is unusable. Locks up, doesn't load different screens and occasionally crashes. Use browser instead..."
4,It is a little harder than the computer website because I have not used it much. But I like to have it on my phone so I have it everywhere I go and can use it to unlock my delivery box too.
1,"It seems Amazon has a variation on customer abuse in addition to delivery abuse to diasabled customers. Amazon presents an ""update"" for the Amazon Shopping app. View the drop down and you are presented with ""What's New"". No bug fixes are listed. No security fixes are listed. For weeks of update after update, you get the same twelve line self promotion. NOT NEW!! NO update information here. NO substance here. Perhaps you can consult a Smart Twelve Year Old to help you with this wrong-mindedness."
5,"I have been a prime customer for 6 yrs. Never wrote them a review. And I have many good experiences with them. Just in case your issue is never fixed, call them and they will make it straight"
1,My basket is empty but it was full of stuff I wanted to buy and compare. Why has it emptied? I didn't do this. I've lost all the things +£3k+ worth of items I'm wanting to purchase.
1,"Really having serious problems with this app closing arbitrarily after I last updated! It was never great, frankly, and the updates only make matters worse. So annoyed with it!!"
1,App keeps changing my language settings to Spanish... I don't speak Spanish. This keeps happening every week! No matter how many times I change it to English.
2,This app needs to have a way to filter out country of origin. The amount of cheap made in China products that show up clog up the feed every time I try to find something.
1,"No more deals! Amazon has become greedy like all the other global companies. Check local, it's often cheaper than getting it from Amazon."
2,"Like how Amazon has finally updated the whole user interface, but please fix the bugs, right now, “Your order” page won't load..."
5,"I have this app on all my devices & it works great in all cases. I get what I need, in most cases I get my products promptly, & I can track my packages with a great deal of accuracy. Love the app & I love Amazon"
1,"Good luck getting your packages on time! Manipulated reviews on tons of products now and not just china vendors, amazon itself manipulates products they sell as well. Bye bye"
1,Canceled all my subscription and orders just now. Usps won't deliver my packages all of a sudden. Amazon does good but not usps. I cant take the risk of it coming from them.
1,The app switched the language to Spanish and won't let me put it back to English. Very frustrating. Calling Amazon was zero help!
2,Everything was working fine bit from the 2nd last update the currency keeps jumping back to Dollar from my currency ZAR. Then I have to change the settings again. Never had this issue.
5,I love Amazon Prime but some of their products are smaller than I imagined when I get them to my house... I like that you get great deals and free shipping.....
1,"Warning to people who order large items. Don't! Your item will end up ""lost,"" and you can be assured NOTHING will be done about it other than a refund."
1,"I'm not sure what's happened to the app but it won't let me checkout, it keeps wanting me to select a delivery option which I do but it doesn't progress from the page"
1,Freezes and stops TOO often. Slow with refreshing. If it wasn't Amazon I would delete and shop elsewhere.
1,"Worst Policy for Missing Product in UK. I bought a New Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G Phone & the delivered package is missing the phone, adapter and C-Type Cable! And the customer service provides a solution to file a report! Why? Why Amazon doesn't take responsibility to do the investigation itself of how phone got missing, provide the customer a replacement with the actual phone rather than a empty box!!! Money Paid, Didn't Get The Product & I should take up trouble to initiate investigate? NO!!"
1,I have ordered a package 3 times and drivers are not putting on my front door or lockers. They keep leaving them in apartment laundry room. Per risk and loss clause is BS. Amazon should still be liable until it's at my front door like notated because the driver is not following delivery instructions. IT'S CLEARLY NOTED in SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS and YOUR DRIVERS aren't FOLLOWING and violates the Claus!!
1,It keeps prompting me with an old phone number that I no longer have for 2nd level verification and no way to update system with current phone number so I'm just delaying the app
4,Any plans to add dark mode to the app? This would be great for those that have eye issues or other disabilities and use assisted modes.
1,This app is horrible. Most of the time I continue to receive the massage that something has gone wrong when trying to open app.
1,Bugging out a lot lately. Thumbnails don't display and the ordering of elements is broken.
1,"My app is up to date and yet the ""your orders"" won't open. It started a few months back and I hate it. The app works well for my husband's phone but not for my galaxy. Please fix you app. Listen to you consumers."
2,Was offered a 30 day free trail and they tried to charge me after 5 days so I canceled. We not order anything from them.
4,"Alot of issues have been fixed but some remain. The app keeps freezing after long use. It also freezes quickly when editing my lists...ex.marking an item(s) 'highest' on my list, adding comments like ""for garage"", or moving to another list. When editing a list, I wish it would go back to the spot I left off & not to the top of the list. Not OK when you have longer lists. There are Customers who plan projects,etc with long lists. Please make searches more accurate."
4,"The application and the service are good but you have to add the option if shopping the list of the seller, this is very important as many people would like to order more than one product from the same seller, and is almost impossible now.. Please try to make it available to shop by clicking on the seller's name just like (souq application) in the past."
1,"Big ad for Lord of Rings Rings of Power or whatever when I open the app. I have no interest in this, and will cancel my Amazon credit card, uninstall the app, cancel prime, and never use Amazon again if they think this annoying marketing is going to make me do something I have zero interest in doing. Garbage app."
3,Amazon shopping app doesn't allow user to clear the search history. No option to clear searching like eBay or other shopping app.
2,I use Amazon for a lot of things including groceries. Two recent grocery deliveries have me angry though. Product was opened and until I got to it a week later didn't know. And the second delivery product packaging was damaged and taped. I had to throw that away as well. Go to try and report and get a refund and the app says sorry can't return it (obviously) and has a button to contact them for a refund but it just loops back to the same return process with noone to contact. How frustrating.
1,If returned they pay not the total amounts which you paid for purchase something... All the products you shop here that's way more different then the picture which seller puts here specially about the quality
2,"I've had Amazon/Prime well over two years now. I've never had any issues with the prime app, watching certain movies or my deliveries being on time until Yesterday!!! I ordered a phone case & phone holder & the notification said that it had been delivered & given directly to a resident, when in fact I wasn't home at the time, so given to who exactly? I never seen anyone on my door bell camera at all. I've reported the issue & I'm hoping that it's taken care of properly."
5,"Love it ordered a new fridge 3 days delivered installed and removal old one. 40$ fee only best service than looking all over city and hassle that items not in stock and waiting only display model in store. Great job amazon, Alexa, all emplyees."
1,New update made it difficult for me to search and find items with the layout they have now. Too big.
1,"Search ignores what I type, and instead shows me whatever ad they want to push, or more than just auto corrects very specific search terms. Viewing useful past order info in app is a pain: must click 2 or 3 levels deeps just to view purchase details like cost. Then hit back twice to get list of orders again, but it reloads that page so you start at top again. Charge info sent to credit card so vague and hard to reconcile with my statements. Sometimes freezes when trying to view pictures."
1,"Terrible customer service. None of your information is cohesive. Placed an order for cat food and accidentally set the deliver date to the 31st instead of 30th. Promptly contacted Amazon to change the date (which they ""said they did"") and then later confirmed with a different associate that date ""was indeed changed to the 30th. Here I am, it's the 30th going on 4pm, hasn't shipped. I then contacted again and then was told there's no option to change the delivery date. So I was lied to. Terrible"
2,"Too many issues, account is always on hold everytime I try to make a purchase. They need to fix this issue."
1,"Amazon has absolutely plummeted in quality lately. My deliveries are frequently late, some go to the wrong address. Packages are extremely damaged with loose pieces of the item in them. I've come to expect a lot higher quality than this. It's sad."
2,"Okay, this may just be an issue with me but I'll try to explain it best I can. Everything I do results in an error. Literally everything on this app. Like, I press the ""RETURN TO AMAZON HOME"" button and the same error appears AGAIN. It's getting unusable and out of hand. I have to use the site on my phone now, it's that bad."
1,There is no way to remove that stupid Alexa button at the bottom corner. It bothers me big time. It gets in the way!!!!!!
3,First time using couldn't complete order..don't want Alexa.. and said my email wasn't valid and wouldn't take my card. I only have one card. The one I get my Ss Widow benefit. Nothing else is wrong it works on other places. On line.
3,"EDIT: I dropped two stars in 2022 when Google Play stopped letting me purchase my Kindle books IN my Amazon app. This is asinine stupid. WHY do I have to go to my browser on my phone to purchase a Kindle book?? Put it back. FIX THIS GOOGLE PLAY! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Amazon Shopping is EXTREMELY easy to use. It keeps track of all my Amazon transactions for me, and also has wish lists...actually, it's just like that website only ten times easier to view and maneuver around in. Quicker, too."
1,"Whenever I attempt to manage my Prime membership, the app states that I am unable to sign up for Prime on the app. So then I attempt to access the website from my mobile chrome browser, which then automatically sends me to the app, I don't even have the option to do otherwise. Prime seems to be somewhat significant when it comes to Amazon, so why are you unable to manage a membership on its application? It doesn't make sense to me"
1,"Worst app I've ever used, deliveries always late and they do nothing to help. I'll just stick with other ordering sites from now on."
1,"I was shopping on the desktop and a banner ad popped up saying that if I downloaded the app, there was an offer for $15 off my next 2 purchases made in the app. I downloaded it and it turns out that offer expired last year. Why was it still being promoted on the site? The app is significantly less functional than shopping on the website in a regular browser. Do not recommend overall."
2,"I don't know what they did recently, but I cannot look up my orders. It just flashes on the screen. I even uninstalled and reinstalled. The app sucks!"
2,"Latest version doesn't work for me. Can't view home, orders or lists. Eventually it times out with error message, a nice dog picture or returns to original page. All other apps like ebay are still quick and responsive, so is not my wifi or phone. Have cleared cache, data, even reinstalled but no change."
1,When I scan boxes to see what the item is it says error please reload page and will only allow me to add item to cart and not pull it up to view. On an android phone
4,Do not like it that with latest update it's hard to find when I want to change country and language.
2,"Yh good and easy at the moment of purchase but when you are looking FOR SOMEYHING SPECIFIC then you can type any phrase/string of word and it will NOT make the search any better. Even with the filter the results are wrong and NON-specific to what you filtered. Please can you make it so when I search for a Fridge WITHOUT freezer, I actually get those results. It's disgusting that you can't find what you know you want because u guys just want us to see every listing across amazon Quite despicable"
3,'View your orders' doesn't work. It just keeps trying to refresh. When it does work the pages constantly hobfrom one to the next. Frustrating
1,I use to swear by Amazon. Anything I needed I went through Amazon. Well save you money for prime is my suggestion. I have made 3 important purchases off Amazon for the simple fact it said it would be delivered before the date I needed the items by. Well they did not arrive. 2 of them i had to just reorder at different places and received them within 2 days. Save your money just not worth it.
1,"I'm changing my review down to 1 star bc I'm getting fed up with their filters, especially price one. The app itself seems to work good"
2,This app is junk 8 out of 10 times I get uh-oh something went wrong on our end. If you ask me you're better off using the web instead of this app
1,Not trustworthy and reliable at all. I placed an order. It was never delivered. Amazon at first touch gave fake promises for next and next and next days. Eventually they never sent. They refused telling me when it will be sent. They even refused refund! They just passed me from one online assistant to another one. Finally thanks to my bank I managed to take back my money! The customer service is pretty rude. Just horrible and not responsible at all. I wish I could give a zero score!
2,"Worse than the site. Handles all the Amazon links, and provides a worse interface than the site would. Admittedly, it does have useful delivery notifications, but then they add Prime and which cannot be skipped (""Continue shopping"" doesn't work) other than by killing the app. Given that I do have prime subscription, trying to upsell it by ruining the UX doesn't quite align with LP, but then who cares?"
3,The app lately has been very laggy! It tales forever to even get it to load. Doesn't matter if I'm on my phone or tablet.
3,10/21/22 3.3 GB Update!!! Boy it better wipe my *zz for that much data. I pay for that data Amazon! Update 10/29/22 Now a 3.5 GB Update!!! 🤬
4,I would not recomend buying a phone from Amazon they will give you everything that's supposed to come with a new phone except the one thing you have to have to activate your phone a SIM card. That's just Amazon's way of trying to make more money since they do actually sell SIM cards. TOTAL BS AND THAT'S FACTS.
4,"OVERALL, LOVE AMAZON & GOOGLE, BUT CAN BE FRUSTERATING SOMETIMES!! BUT OVERALL, I BELIEVE MY HUBBY, SON AND I FIGURED-IT OUT?? BUT AGAIN I WILL CORRECT AND OR UPDATE MY VIEW/OPINION/POST IF NEEDED-BE! THX."
5,"I can honestlly say Ive had nothing but positive experiences within the apps customer service. If I ever have an issue, they are always polite and quick to fix it, alot of times going above and beyond. Its a rare find these days. The people I speak with need a raise because customer service jobs are NOT easy, it takes a special breed to do those jobs, any service jobs for that matter. Much respect and appreciation."
5,"I love to shop Amazon. Especially for gifts, don't have to worry about packing and mailing them. If I have problem it always get resolved quickly 😉"
1,"Unusable with a VPN: the region and language settings get automatically changed based on the VPN region, even though I have an account with language and region settings already set. This makes the user experience really bad, this issue should definitely be resolved."
2,Crashes everytime I try to edit something on my baby registry. After every item I add I have to close out the app and reopen it to do anything else. I'm seriously considering switching completely to Target. It's much easier and has better deals most of the time.
1,"Now there is popup adds which I hate. Shipping times and prices are going the wrong direction. Membership is almost 200 a year with taxes. I've been doing more purchases on other sites cause prices are better ie.. newegg, walmart and ebay. Search engine doesn't narrow down/filter options well. Customer service is also going wrong direction. 😑"
5,"I find everything that I am looking for that i needed. Convenience of shopping from home at your fingertips, saves on gas and time"
1,"Today while on Amazon looking for an e-bike, I found one and there were no reviews on it yet so I went to look at the seller and almost all of his reviews were great but there was two other e-bikes he was selling and all the reviews on those said scams when I asked Amazon how come this guy has these reviews on two items why do they still allow him to just keep selling those items because more people are getting ripped off every day the item's are still there for sale IS AMAZON RESPONSIBLE?"
2,"Always found the app usable, not the greatest set up but worked. I can now only purchase kindle books from going to online shop. Audible purchases have issues too. And then after updating it I can't access my orders page, it merely stays blank with a loading circle. I have to go on my history and check what I've brought and check the individual order. A nightmare if like me you order quite a few regular items and want to check delivery. Getting any contact or help is near impissible"
1,"Does Not function properly..., Keeps freezing... Closes out. Maybe it's time for an Update or something 😕"
1,Free with prime? Why can I only get a few songs then. This app is the best advert for Spotify ever
1,"Being unable to even make prime purchases in this or the prime video app is now a major hindrance. I have actually started moving away from amazon video offerings to other streaming sites instead. As for a long running annoyance with this app - you can't filter orders in progress. No way to see which orders are out for delivery. Really basic thing, but absolutely missing from an app for delivering purchases."
1,Loved Amazon till you pay for prime and everytime you order for next day delivery it's late by days sometime weeks don't listen to the false advertising cause it's all lies
1,Prime 2 day shipping is a lie. Even living in a major city they take 4-5 business days to get stuff to our door. I guess profits are king. I cancelled.
1,"The app is fine, but the deliveries, and customer support are terrible. They delivered to the wrong house, a few packages of mine were stolen, then when asked for a refund, they want the item back. Then they want to wait before issuing a refund. Called and tried the custmer chat, no help. Going to delete it pretty soon"
1,Amazon is the worst shopping app ever seen when I order for a value just more than a couple hundred dollars they instantly block my account very very disappointed three accounts already blocked..
4,A little slow to load. Not sure that it really gives a lot more functionality than the web page does (other that sign in permission). Does the job
1,"Clickin reviews with pics/vids still getstuck.Now, it will let you zoom in,but not back out on a pic,then you hav2 exit all reviews 2 go back again. As of 8/28 Can't process a EBT payment that is eligible. After it asks for my pin, it comes back to Amazon saying there's an error and my payment was declined and to update my EBT card but there's nothing wrong with my card.I Kno I have a balance on there2 pay4it.When I try2check EBT balance it gives an""error can't access balance at this time""."
4,I love Amazon! I do wish prime was free but still it's got everything you could want need or think of with great delivery times!
1,"Used to be my most favorite app, and ordered a lot. First of all, I cannot remove Amazon day delivery, ""save"" button it's not working, if I don't pick at least one Amazon day delivery. Delivery time start taking longer,and longer. Last delivery, I have UPS tracking, but delivery hold in purpose,and says it was my request. I am done with Amazon, I wll start ordering,if they fix it, stop delay, and delivery faster, and give me option,to remove Amazon day delivery."
1,"HORRIBLY WRONG!! I have had this amazon account for over 10 years and I LOVEE MYY AMAZON but today when I called to ""restore"" my account I was told that since I've had no activity transactions since late April, my account was deleted and I needed to start over...SCREW THAT AMAZON!! I don't think I'll be using Amazon for ANYTHING again."
1,I've been having trouble with this app for about a month now and I've updated it and everything and it is so slow and sometimes the pages don't even load
1,Why am I getting notices through the local post office on my Amazon order? I didn't order a package to be delivered by a basic mail service that can't fit in the mailbox. I ordered an *Amazon* package to be delivered by an *Amazon* vehicle. Now I have to waste my time going to the post office to pick up a package that won't fit in the mailbox.
3,"I have enjoyed the convenience of this app. And am paying for the use of it, why am I being forced to watch a preview of this Lord of the Rings everytime I open it?! You can't cancel the initial preview and it's infuriating. Not a fan. Not at all."
1,I am so glad to see that I'm not the only one I just got done telling somebody on the customer service and I don't understand what's happening to Amazon because this past year at least since like beginning of Summer and right now since like January I've had nothing but problems with Amazon with their delivery we're trying to talk to somebody I just found out 10 minutes ago they've been charging me for for months since 2020 since 2020 for prime and I'm supposed to get it with my phone membership
1,"Enough with the ads, I don't care for the show Amazon makes, now I have to wait 10 seconds everytime I open the app just so they can sholve ads to me? Now I'm even less likely to watch that stupid lord of the ring show."
3,Not liking the new update. It is not clear of which ones are my recent orders. Total mess. They need to separate the delivered orders and the ones that are still pending.
2,"""Not eligible for a refund"" on a package that never came. Been by the door the entire day, and I even received ALL other packages that day... But one didnt show up. Will update review when this gets corrected. Or, will stop using app."
1,"So now I can't watch or rent automatically on this video app, even though thats what's it's for, and have to switch to another app? This is a ridiculous update. This also happened with amazon kindle, can't purchase e-books anymore."
2,"I hate that I never catch the sales, I get paid every two weeks, of course the sale is over tomorrow 🙄 I get paid on Friday where everything is back to full price. 🤔🤔🤔 maybe there's another app that has longer sales......I think I'm done with Amazon."
1,The worst thing since they change the app and mixed all the settings around. I feel like in a circus... It is a headache just to check orders... Why did you guys change a perfectly made app to this ridiculous thing? I can't for the love of God change the country and the agent is taking centuries to respond a single request. RIDICULOUS!!!!
1,"They are currently forcing you to watch a short ad for their lord of the rings series. I was on the fence about watching it, but now I'm definitely not going to. I'm also a prime customer, so please don't force me to watch ads."
2,"Sometimes newer is not better. This app recently went from being great to pretty much useles with the latest upgrade. Or should I say downgrade. Ever heard the expression, if it ain't broke don't fix it?"
2,I don't like that you can't get a copy of you chat conversations with Amazon support. As soon as the chat ends the chat and everything disappears. I would like some evidence of the support interaction.
1,"Latest update makes the app very clunky and hides some functionality. Not a very user friendly experience, using the website instead."
2,"TAKING MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT, I have metro they gave me a code so i can get free amazon prime so i signed up, i noticed they been takin out money and i called they only refunded that month they couldnt refund all the other months because it was to late, i told them that i came thru metro and its free with my phone they just said call metro pcs . BS and i switched emails to start fresh, because AMAZON suggested and they started taking money again!!!!"
1,They only put up reviews that are good Let people talk about how you can get a items cheaper because They're doubling their money It's just best to go into the store if you don't want to get ripped off As badly I did my study if there's a item at stores for $10 it will be around $20-$25 dollars when you order off Amazon When Amazon 1st started it wasn't bad but now Just like every company that becomes big they do whatever they want
1,The app does not work if you want to do anything other than search for items. You cannot go to account or past orders. Nothing will load even after updating multiple times
2,I like dogs but getting sick of that error page. You can't click fast enough before it errors out. End up just using the mobile site since this is basically just a nosier wrapper for the site.
1,To turn off personalised recommendation push notifications (ie adverts in annoying push notifications) you will be forced to stop Smile charity donations. What a seedy business practice. Customer Service page not correctly displaying after lengthy terrible customer service interaction. Terrible app.
1,When is this App gonna work properly there's always something glitchy with it. It's unintuitive and awkward to navigate and use...its just gets worse not better...and why is there no Amazon.ie....🤬
1,3 times now i purchased something that advertises as delivery next working day for it change it as soon as the purchase is complete and amazon have taken my money. All the times amazon have said its logistical so why not advise this before you take my money and give me option of going elsewhere instead.
2,After the update I don't like that it ask me to finish my Amazon fresh order on another device. Because of the brand of tablet I'm using. I've never had this problem before this recent update and now feel uncomfortable using it.
1,Hey Amazon... Please stop changing the language your app is using! I'm an English speaker. And you keep changing to Spanish or Portuguese or something else! I DO NOT WANT to use any alternative languages than ENGLISH on your app. Fix it NOW or I stop shopping with it.
4,"Great App, but typical google bureaucracy has ruined a cornerstone of its purpose: Being unable to purchase Kindle books through this app anymore is a ridiculous policy creating an unnecessary hassle, and it doesn't make any sense! I have no ill will to the developers here, but where do I register my complaints with Google to urge changing this policy?"
1,I'm so sick of being told my items will be a two-day delivery only to be delayed in transit. You know who has never had a delayed order when I've ordered from them and is free? Wal-Mart online. I'm one more delay away from cancelling my Prime membership.
2,"Something changed today and I can no longer access my orders! I usually press the 3 horizontal lines in the bottom right corner, it brings up short cuts and I click orders. Now it looks different and only 3 options all to get me to shop!"
1,"TikTok runs faster. All buttons have been moved around, just because. When improvement isn't. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD RELIABLE APP"
4,Excellent. Many a times specifications and quantified cost is not readily available. This makes it difficult to compare and choose.
2,"This app is a disaster. Every time they tinker with it the worse it becomes. It is almost worthless on my Samsung S7 tablet. I'm sick of looking at sad dogs carrying the error message ""uh-oh... something went wrong on our end."""
5,Works fine for shopping. Was there a recent update? I can no longer manage Prime membership setting within the app. It's incredibly inconvenient...is there a reason for this??
5,Easy to find anything you need. And my packages that I order usually end up arriving early. Like two to three days earlier than what they say. Fantastic service.
4,"Works great except that you can't but Kindle books via this app either. Not Amazon's fault, however, that Google is greedy for way too big a cut of digital content sold in apps."
1,This company is terrible and they Rob you its OK for them to Cancel your prime if you don't have enough money in bank but as soon as they owe you money they make excuses not to give you it so I canceled prime they said 21 days ago I would get a partly refund cause I never used my benefits of £6.67 now they are saying they don't owe me it they took a monthly payment of me but I canceled after 2 days they were quick enough to stop me watching movies listening to music but won't pay me. Back
2,"Could be better. Search text is white on white, so can't be seen. Sort by price is well hidden. And in general - not app specific - there's too much cr@p from weird made up brands."
1,"For some reason there is NO way to change the language on the app. Furthermore, it doesn't use your system language. Mine is in French even though my system language is in English. Really dumb that you can't change it yourself!"
1,This app is very sensitive to VPN useage and which server your VPN connects to. Using Nord VPN I have to keep changing servers until I find one that Amazon likes. Most sensitive on my S21+. Off shore USA is often acceptable.
1,"It switched countries on me and does not have kindle books available. Quite frankly, I'd rather shop online and remove the app from my phone. It sucks."
1,Nope! Not impressed they took the buy it now option away and you have to go through your shopping cart! That was a big plus for me! Maybe I don't want to buy everything in my cart straight away!
1,"The view invoice option does not exist. I've searched the section that the Amazon official help page says to find it and it's not there. Either they moved it and failed to update the information, or this is a malicious attempt to avoid RMA by making the proof of purchase inaccessible."
1,This app is simply packet-sniffing everything on your phone to sell to marketing companies. Photos? Stolen and distributed. Address book? Copied and sold. Location? App tracks your every move and sells that info to MANY hundreds of companies. Pathetic spying tool!
2,"The UI is not friendly. Learn from Shopee's UI, easy and super user friendy. If only Shopee is available in Europe I wouldn't install Amazon."
3,"Getting really tired of the constant delays in delivery. Original shipping date gets set back week after week until it is next month, or month after that. This has happened so often i am just canceling orders that take longer than 3 weeks to deliver."
1,"stuff bought here is wish level quality, even if you try to find quality products. ***UPDATE*** why is it when i search for a certain product and sort low to high, i end up with products that are not what im looking for?? stop letting your sellers tag stuff their scam merchandise. oh, and good luck getting a hold of support, they dont exist"
1,"The app just doesn't work constantly asking to verify payment for prime but never does it when I go through with it, hasn't worked for over a month and need to go to the website to use prime"
5,"Absolutely amazing customer service, great interface, basically no bugs, works well in any connection. Great app!"
2,"I liked looking at the Amazon site, just browsing, but not anymore. I am so sick of getting at least 10 to 20 junk emails every day from; all from Amazon sponsors. Disgusted"
1,Okay so my 1st order on my new account ( little did Amazon know I had another 1) has been so horrible trying to get my order it didn't even try to process my order for payment until 3 days after I made the order then they didn't even offer faster shipping or anything. Very disappointed
2,"App stopped letting me choose product options. Now if I want anything that has different colors or sizes I can only order through the website. So, what's the point of the app if this doesn't work!?"
1,They lie on reviews. I bought some flash drives that came in individual bags they were suppose to be 3.0 pny 32g. They were 28g and have around 2.0 speeds. I posted this review on the item on amazon and Amazon took it down and said I was a lier lol.
3,I don't ever see the option for buying movies to stream from the Amazon app. It was nice when we could purchase from the video app.
1,"""Your Orders"" page doesn't work. It comes up with ""UH-OH. Something went wrong on our end."". I am on the latest update. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app with no change to the problem."
1,"Can't buy digital content now and when I try to use the website it kicks me into the app. F Google. @Google, you going back on your word isn't going to make me buy digital from you. @Amazon, grow a pair and start your own app. Again."
1,"Horrible. The lied and say they are in the United States, make up a name that's not theirs to sound like they are domewtic. They try to charge you for an item you never received, and don't care. If I wasn't afraid to lose all my photos in my Amazon devices I would cancel."
1,"Hackers have access through this app, app did not allow me to shop and it added a virus to phone, phone off and in airplane mode, was turned on remotely through Microsoft share 😑"
1,"Try to buy one product 3 times! And every single time was ""delivered"" but actually I've never received anything! And was a nightmare to get the refund! I'M DELETING IT ! HAD ENOUGH! GOOD LUCKY Y'ALL"
2,I had 99+ things in my cart before and now Amazon wants to put like 380 of those things in save for later And I tried to put all the stuff in save for later back in cart and when I do that it puts something from my cart in save for later so fix your app Amazon!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
2,"For such an advanced filthy rich company, the app is quite basic, buggy, and hard to navigate such simple things. The messaging service to sellers has been the most frustrating and moronic which has driven me to leave this review"
1,"The time when i decided that Amazon is not good !! I keep trying to take my money back for an item , because was a mistake made by the seller, i write in chat 3 times and everytime the same result ""We gonna write to the seller and if they don't fix your problem write us back"" ,everytime i write them back they write to the seller ... They should have proper employees to the chat, that should fix the problems!!!!!"
1,Unusable. This app used to be one of my favorites. The updates have ruined the app so much I've actually uninstalled it. I'll just stick to using the website where I can actually see my purchase history and daily deals.
1,"It's almost like if you're not a prime member, they don't care about your package at all. Ever since I cancelled my prime membership, I have had numerous issues when I order from Amazon."
1,"Amazon exports the goods everywhere,it's ok but there is no warning or info about that we just can import maximum 2 pieces of something, it's nonsense, I'm not gonna buy anymore from abroad or on Amazon. 👎🏼 And they don't refund your all money."
1,"Per usual, it's making returns as difficult as possible. It won't let me click the continue button when I try to return an item, just beyond the, Why Are You Returning This? screen."
2,Item dispatched and sold by Amazon marked as undeliverable because an issue on their side and over a week later they say they are waiting for the item to be returned so they con process my refund.... If you cannot deliver you should not withhold my money
1,"App is slowly, its easy to search things and move between items, its not easy to enter a brand and just see there items, i saw a small new apps doing better than this hope to make some changes"
5,I Love it but you are taking 14.95 for one thing every month and 14.99 1 is for Prime Video and I don't know what they are both I think when was one is prime but I don't have a prime card if did I would be able to shop for food and drinks as well snacks for my Grandkids and for the big kids to my daughter and her husband to so the little kid has their own snacks and daddy will have his own snacks but you my snap was turned down by whom ever is on the other end of my order and all food is good
4,"The app works well now but for some reason all of my notifications come at the same time after the package has been sitting on my porch for awhile. Package arriving, see where it is on a map, delivered, how did we do.... um ok"
1,My invoice gave me a total amount of. $117.00. Now it says $194.00. That is a hell of a difference!!! I am totally unhappy with this purchase very misleading. It was also supposed to be divered today. Now it says tomorrow!!!
2,"Can't clear search, can only change text to search on. Navigating back preserves search text. Does not work with VPN often."
1,Can't apply $1400 gift card to order. Apparently not a single customer service representative cant figure out a way to apply a gift card to my current order without telling me to cancel it and reorder. The product I want is out of stock so that's impossible so they are basically holding my gift card funds hostage! Ridiculous.
2,"No better than wish. 15 years ago Amazon was great you could get the cheapest games and text books. Things were great, but now it's all cheaply made trash. I don't know why I keep using it."
1,"Very poor customer service. Because of the terrible service, I have canceled all Amazon apps I was paying for. They already wouldn't allow a couple of product reviews because they were negative. They will also probably remove this rating and opinion as well. A company that's more interested in money and supporting manufacturing in places that also feel the same about people."
5,"Thank you so much I became disabled this last summer, I've never used any mail or delivery service because it became such a chore then frustration with app or they couldn't find address. Your a God send . Thank you, Regina gale las vegas, ya have me as a customer for good,"
5,I lik~ how Amazon i doing a alert if you can't afford something they will let you know when it goes on sale... Sweet.. And my list is long. Got to dig the daily deals as well and at a fair price..
5,Suggestion. . . I know I'm not the only one who's probably said this but I would really love it if they would include an image of the item being purchased in the email notification once an item is purchased.
2,"Most recent update hides my order history and requires way too many clicks to check on an order. Sad that with all the resources Amazon available, their app is so bad."
1,"I was able to overlook the glitchy app, horrible search engine results, ever increasing price of membership, etc. but after they removed every product review I've written over the years and blocked my account due to leaving several reviews that were 3-4 stars ratings, I'm done with this bs."
3,Cannot find an invoice option in my order details. Where did that go? Way too many advertisements and suggestions. Got harder to search. Otherwise it's a convenient way to shop.
1,I purchase prime for TV yet get error code 9068. A error Amazon claim on their web site to have fixed yet they have not.. bye bye Amazon cancelled prime and Amazon unlimited music .eBay and Netflix from now on.
4,Overall pretty good. I give it only 4 stars because I can no longer buy ebooks through the app. Ridiculous. Google is responsible for that inconvenience as well.
1,Absolutely terrible app only downloaded to verify my age. Uninstall stick to the web browser and do without. Your loss Amazon. Waiting forever looking at a stupid orange circle loading unable to get onto my personal account. Rubbish!
2,App has so much unnecessary clutter. Calling into the customers service if the app fails is worse. Amazon's offshore team is terrible they try to avoid effort to resolving issues. Everyday I move away from buying here more and more.
2,"Updated the app now it thinks I'm in another country, won't let me change it, order, all account history gone? Chat help couldn't see any history, then he explained it logged me into Europe customer service help, but I'm on other side of the pond so he couldnt figure out what to do either."
1,"I've spent weeks trying to get back into my account but haven't been able to because there is a unkown number linked to my account which I have to be able to verify my account through. I do not have access to whatever number is linked to my account but that's the only way to get in. I also try to access customer service but you have to have an account, well I can't create a new one because my email is linked to my old one and the help option doesn't actually help with what I need."
4,"Where does my 'BUY NOW' button keep going ? Occasionally when updated my buy now button dissappears. And the rating section of a product, like say dog food an then scroll down an u can see like 20+ more dog food comparisons with all the ratings and reviews. That dissappears almost daily. I love that section I base a ton of my purchases from going thru those and reading an comparing them. Plz fix. Tysm devs for the work u do!"
1,"I will definitely not be shopping on Amazon much anymore. I can no longer purchase my eBooks on the app so I have to have a third access point to Amazon on my phone just to purchase ebooks. I will stop making purchases from Amazon. if I could, I would give Amazon a zero"
1,"If I search for adult toys, there are no image thumbnails for products. What the F? If you click on an item it verifies age, but that doesn't apply to searches for some reason. Fix your shyte."
5,The greatest most genius thing amazon ever did was create amazon lockers and their own shipping service. Vastly better than dealing with usps. Ups. And fedex. I dont even shop at ebay anymore because of the convenience of amazon lockers.
1,"It was perfect until they disabled the option to take a screenshot at check out, so I passed the exact amount to whoever I am buying to see shipping and taxes now it is very annoying"
1,"Get rid of the ads. If I'm in a hurry, I don't want to have to wait whilst I'm subjected to an ad when I open the app - whether it's for the latest film or to join Prime."
1,"I ordered an electric cooker from amazon and received it damaged. I had to wait for 5 days for them to come and pick it, then another five days of chasing to prepare a replacement cooker, and another few days of chasing to know that the replacement is also damaged, they cancelled the order without even sending me a notification or an email, and now i have wait 7 working days to get refunded so i go with the same loop, pls you expect more than 30 days to get a next day delivery item."
5,They take VERY good care of Prime Members! I am satisfied with monthly cost. You get alot of perks for such a low cost! The site is closely monitored for potential issues.
1,"I can't trust Amazon any more! Lately I bought a laptop from Amazon and they accepted the order and told me that they shipped it.. so I sold my old one and planned my work with the estimated arrival date. Then after 10 days they sent me a message that the order was cancelled because the prices are changed! I called the arab customer service, they responded with a cold blood that there is nothing we can do for you.."
3,It looks like the app has some defects recently. It's because I ordered few stuffs and they arrived but in my app it shows that those products are yet to be delivered.....
3,Much better before foreign vendors! I don't like ordering things from far away that take forever or 3rd party vendors. The point of paying for Prime is (almost) instant gratification!
3,"Not a great look on Z Fold phones. Very grainy and low resolution, and the tablet app doesn't work either."
5,Very user-friendly and dependable delivery. I have had no problems with shopping or returning purchases with Amazon. Thanks
1,"Just got up and running on my tablet. It was nice with larger, clearer pics and faunts. So I placed some orders and BOOM! Message today says it will no longer work on that device. BOOOOOO! I hate lazy programmers!"
5,"App is easy to use and very convenient on almost anything you could want or need to buy, and usually you receive your order in a day or two, however, it is sometimes longer on larger items"
1,"""Uh oh... something went wrong on OUR end"" messages for basic searches. Never have a had so many errors as I did after this update. Garbage!"
1,I shop a ton on amazon and i like the deals but my buttons take several minutes to show up and i end up missing a lot which makes me not want to shop anymore! Why does this keep happening??
1,This app use open by default when hitting received links or links on YouTube but now the links take you to the browser website. Why did Amazon remove the ability to set their app to open by default?
3,"Amazon is the best and I love this app but the maygor problem with this app is The service is not available in Pakistan That's why I don't use this app please make you service available In Pakistan with home delivery in citys like Karachi, Hyderabad,Hala and more by the way love the app ever stuff that I can imagine and this is what I want to say hope you replay 😊😁"
5,I love this app. I have a problem sometimes when I try to scroll up or down when over an area where I can side scroll. I think it gets confused or something. Other than that it's awesome
4,"I've always counted on Amazon for great prices on various products. Why, suddenly, is everything in Spanish? I do not speak or read Spanish - in fact i live in America and our national language is English, bad English, but English nonetheless."
2,"The app was updated and I can't even find where my orders are. It's a shopping app and I can't find what I ordered., Makes no sense. All these unnecessary menus aren't needed"
1,This is a trillion dollar company with an app that runs like I have 2G internet. Loading time is insanely slow. Can allocate some resources to fix this issue.
1,"NEVER USE AMAZON! they literally rip u off I never received my items that I order and was promised a refund if I waited until after the 10 of oct. And was told to contact them this morning(10/11) to get a full refund then they literally gave me the runaround and said they can't refund it even tho they should since I never received my items, they are literally robbing people of theyre money !!! I WILL NEEEVVVERR USE AMAZON AGAIN! ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY AND RIPPING PEOPLE OFF."
5,Got a lot of things from Amazon and I find Amazon Prime worth it. With the amount of times I get stuff from Amazon the fast and free shipping is amazing. 10/10 would recommend.👍
1,Terrible customer service. I've talked to 3 different people to get help on the same problem only for my package to not show up on time and when contacted about this told that it will arrive in another 5 days.
1,please either make the app shortcuts customizable or stop removing the orders shortcut. i don't care about the treasure truck; i get sms notifications. i care about my most recent orders in the app. ugh.
1,No option to turn off auto play on videos. Prime members get advertised to obnoxiously. Not all of us are interested in tictoc type of media.
1,No support when it comes to money being taken from. Your bank to find out it was a game bikecraft £16.53 no one purchased how does this happen? And then you can't actually cancel the purchased! What a big massive fraud company
1,Screenshot everything you buy. amazon has been removing 3rd party purchases. I track down my purchase info from an email in my spam folder. And don't leave a cluster of 1 star reviews or they erase every review you've posted and prevent you from posting more. I call customer service ( india) who repeats the website. No action taken. Crooked AF. Why would i trust the reviews if honest reviews are being deleted!?!
1,Orders are DELAYED for no reason. Shopping with Amazon has turned into a bad experience. Might as well go to AliExpress where you never know when items will be delivered for better prices.
1,"App is really slow and search and UI is not great , can't sort using the filters they show random things despite selecting."
1,"They force ads for their own junk series on you as soon as you open the app, and it is impossible to scroll on ads of people streaming. Ridiculous."
1,"After new update app is no longer on my screen, neither the main screens or the app screens. I have to go to the app store or do an app search to open it."
1,"I cannot be logged into this app under my log on & Prime Video's undrr my partners logon on the same phone. It's either one logon for both apps on the same pho e, or nothing at all. So vlosing my account"
1,"Slow, Clunky and Power Hungry. Great if you like labrador retrievers though since that's what they show when the app throws an error which is frequent. This is before you consider how Amazon itself has turned into an expensive alibaba."
1,Another late delivery. -1. Another late delivery-2. Another late delivery -3. Another late delivery -4. -5 now. The last 3 were within a month. This is all within a 4 month period. Don't support these people.
2,The app freezes and crashes all the time. I have made sure to install all updates and still messes up.
1,"It always says ""estimated delivery 1-3 days"" but once it takes my money everything gets delayed a week which is ridiculous. I might as well switch over to the other place that garuntees the quality and tells me the real shipping date before I order it."
1,"Amazon sucks now they use to be reliable and have good coustumer service,lol not these days I have had 12 orders either taken to the neighbors delayed at the very last second which in turn cost me money or out right cancelled, now I spend at least 800$ a month through Amazon I call to inquire about why this continues to occur the representative got a attitude like I was inconveniencing them I loved Amazon people,do you here me loved them, after today I wouldn't order Air to breathe from them."
1,"Full screen video ads disable this app. On launch, the ad plays and the app never works. No options to disable."
1,"App's sluggish up to the point it gets on my nerves especially at checkout. I also tried applying a voucher only for it to be ""redeemed""/used but not applied to the product during payment although product qualified for the voucher."
1,"I absolutely hate this new layout. Every time I get used to where everything is on the Amazon app, they go and redesign it. This update is the worst."
1,"Not Happy at all with new update! Looking at my orders was really easy before update, now I am made to go through several more steps to see them. App also stays white screen and won't load upon opening sometimes!"
1,"After update, I can't check out and purchase anything. I keep clicking ""proceed to checkout"" and just loads me back into the cart. I tried force closing the app, delete and reinstall and nothing"
3,"Very easy to use, right now the only drawback is in my lists it does not fill up the screen, it makes it all to one side and it's very hard to read"
1,Absolutely the slowest app out there. Doesnt matter if Im on WiFi or Data. I often shop other places simply because I get so frustrated waiting for the app.
3,10/02/2022 Amazon Prime is to expensive for free delivery and your application of movies and such. Without the prime I was offered a great deal on a purchase. Let's see when it will arrive.
1,"I HATE that the App plays video without permission of ""influencers"" talking about products or advertising videos. Makes me not want to shop on Amazon. Causes laggy performance and I'm on a S10."
1,"Why am I opening this app to be immediately accosted by a full screen add for LOTR? And then it doesn't even go away afterwards, turns into a half screen add, then several more LOTR adds using alexa and fire tv to advertise it. Uninstalling"
4,I can honestly say that my family but mostly me have been a fan for almost a decade I like the prices and I'm able to get stuff that I don't always have to go into the store to buy especially clothes and furniture which has been great buying from Amazon my only issue is that if you live in a house that has a screen door some of the drivers will put your package right in front of your screen door so opening your door to get your package
1,I am seeking legal advice toward Amazon. I have done all asked to gain access to my account and they still are not letting me get in my account. Yet they keep charging me monthly. I have been trying for a year now. I have even called customer service. They are stealing my money and not letting me in my account.
1,"This app has me at my wits end! It's so susceptible to sliding right to the other ""tabs"". Then whatever search or item I was viewing is gone and I have to search it up again."
1,"Bring back the old amazon where delivery is free if you are a prime member and free sending it back, nowerdays you get charged just to send an item back.. yet even the prime is expensive! Ebay it is for me then!!!!!"
1,"Why would I use an app that hits me with an ad everytime it opens? You made your app even slower to use, congratulations. Skip this app just use your web browser as it is faster and more relevant."
2,You can no longer send an email to get assistance with items. Items have been getting lost in transit at a higher rate and now I have no easy way to find a solution.
1,IMPORTANT: Amazon now double charges when using any debit card; one full price pre-authorization charge and one full price purchase charge. This isn't a joke and verified by their customer service. 5-10 days until the pre-authorization charge will fall off.
5,"Amazon is like a Mega-Mall of an app. It has millions of merchandises, an eGrocery store that takes E.B.T. Cards, also gives you half-price prime membership discount for SNAP/Medicaid Recipients!! It also provides two day-delivery, NEXT Day Delivery, and Same Day Delivery, how cool is that!! They also notify you when on delivery day when your package is on it's way, you can even track the driver on a map your phone that also tells you how much delivery stops the delivery guy has to make first!!"
5,"Great app great service. Absolutely love the Holiday Kids Gift booklet I just got in the mail, reminds me of when i was a kid looking through the sears catalog etc for Christmas gifts , has stickers in it too."
5,"Easy to use and great account security very tight. The Communitys knowledge was very helpful. Haven't seen a more user friendly web presence in the retail market. Regards,."
2,I can't even get the new app to let me sign up amazon prime.I tried uninstall and reinstall anything helps.Says mobile app not allowed to sign up for prime .Come on people really .Home computer works fine and allows you sign up that way .BUT I WANT IT ON MY PHONE .
2,"""Uh-oh, something went wrong"", is a common occurance. Entire contents not loading anymore. Can't load cart. Often can't save to Wishlists. Basically saying - Don't buy anything here."
2,I can't uninstall this app I installed I just want to use the original sign in Amazon website which is way better this is driving me bananas. I tried everyway with no success it like it got me by the nuts and won't let go
2,"In general the app is alright, but that you are forced to use Spanish (or Portuguese) language for items AND the app once you change to Amazon Spain, is just ridiculous"
1,"Sucks, will be ending my prime subscription. Deliveries keep getting slower and slower, constantly being pushed back even later. Delivery time was the only reason Amazon used to be worth a damn"
1,"I'm a foreigner in Turkey, and somehow the app doesn't have an eng language option. Why??? If that's possible, add it, please. Thousands of expats would be thankful!!"
2,"4.5 rating is a lie, and I took another star off because Amazon is becoming straight garbage now. What I don't like about Amazon is not knowing which company will be used to return a product because USPS is great but ups is garbage and takes 7 days or more to process a return and receive your refund. The new CEO of Amazon suxass..."
2,The app keeps switching from my English setting to Spanish . I have to delete it and then add it back. Since I can't read Spanish.
1,All of a sudden my app was in another language and i had to uninstall because i could not figure out how the hell to change it when i can't read it! This is ridiculous!
1,"This app is TERRIBLE! We shouldn't even need this for support, you should run a normal, friendly website. Then the app doesn't even have that, so it was a waste of my time. Amazon has gone to 💩"
2,Terrible UI/UX. Can't find anything and I'm always shown the same items over and over again. How is this an app owned by an almost trillion dollar company? Embarrassing.
1,What a joke. The customer service is rude and a joke. Had a problem with a gift registry return. The man kept yelling at me like I was stupid. I could not find the item because of them removing it due to lawsuits. After I had already return the item. Needless to say I never got my money back.
1,Changed my Country from the US to UK and will not let me change it back. I went to the content and devices and it says there is NOTHING connected there as well!!
1,"Truly curious as to what is the use of going through all the extra time to set up the added delivery information such as where to deliver and what times you're allowed to deliver and then they try and deliver in the middle of the night anyways, be smart enough to read the darn instructions that you requested for added delivery information, you got to be kidding how dumb can you be to try and deliver at 10:00 at night when I specifically said between 9:00am and 5:00pm"
1,"I keep uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, hoping it will work better. Doesn't. What is happening? I even quit Prime because I find that I don't use Amazon as much as before."
5,"Amazon is unbelievable, fast delivery and a selection of items. I have several of there services and the price is right."
2,App kinda sucks. If you do anything else it kicks you out of where you're at. Whether your shopping or in a customer support chat. It just kicks you out if you have to open any other app. It would also be nice if it offered more suggestions of things it would think you'd like.
1,App full of bugs and duplicate the accounts. As well call centers in Egypt that doesn' t speak very well. Than cannot access since the latest update of the Android app!!!
1,They are going to lose a lot from me I have unstall your app and I have removed my cards my information and I no longer have prime I will no longer do business with you I wish you the best of luck I do my business now on eBay where they care about your stuff when they send it and make sure that you have reserved your merchandise Amazon order at your own risk even paying high price of shipping you go on eBay it's free shipping 4 days guaranteed you'll get it never fails me .
5,I love this app! It would be awesome if you could creadit people for the money they spend in the form of Amazon Gift cards 😀 As well as making it so people can renew their prime membership in the app
1,"Why tf are you guys using the shopping app to promote prime video content? Everytime I open the app I have to sit through a stupid, useless video of some show and can't go to the shopping section until scrolling down for ages. Revert this back to the original."
3,It could be better but it is good. I think when you want to move some items from one folder to another I wish you could select more than one item at a time to move at once.
1,"Strangely, not able to get pass the cart. No matter the item, pressing ""processed to checkout"" just reboots the back to the cart."
1,"This app just gets more and more difficult to use. Its amazing that seven years ago I purchased a set of casters, now every time I open amazon they reccomend that I buy casters."
1,"Thanks for including an add when we open the app... Not! Next, will we have to pay to remove the add from app, too? I never thought I'd say this, but Walmart is looking a lot better these days."
1,It is a good e-commerce company. As long as I paid cash on delivery I got it within the specified time. After time over due to paying in advance and my item still not arrived. It is some kind of corruption😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
4,Amazon is great Google play sucks . Seems Google play won't let Amazon sell ebooks any longer. Pretty inconvenient to have to buy ebooks from the Amazon web page and not through the app.
2,"Due to price gouging e-commerce, Amazon is only good if you can price match. Due to the sites inability to decipher a good deal from a bad one you must manually scroll through pages of the same product over and over to try and find one yourself. Honestly unless you are going to invest some serious time between the price gouchers and inflation helpers you are better off with local retailers. And I promise you you're happiness will be more important to a local business."
1,Can't remove my address that for some reason is connected to my dad's one (he is passed away 2 months ago) in Italy. That make me so mad I can't even keep using this joke of an app. Straight back to eBay. Thanks for nothing
3,New update 9/2022 has messed up my Amazon account. When I open the app it says uh oh something went wrong on our end. Uninstalled /Reinstalled and it still says the same thing !Please fix the update !!!
4,"It's only take one week, which is great. But... Why'd you say my order arriving at 8, it's already 8.10 now 😭😡 and you charged me twice 😡 I'm angry, betrayed and sad. But seriously, your UI is confusing, I can't even find my previous CS messages."
5,I think is one of the best apps to buy stuff of being a customer for a long time you know and you won't be disappointed this is the best app they have a lot of good stuff so I recommend it to you the best one that is of the I have almost everything that is in my house from them household so thank you Amazon
1,I tried to order a recliner in the shipping prices are out of sight I found one made and shipped by Amazon it's always shipping shipping shipping price the way I understood after you order something over $35 it should be free shipping but not oh no no no no the guns are rip off I've been hung up on I've been lied to I've been everything by your Amazon employees but I'm sick and tired of trying to buy a recliner that everything has outrageous shipping and handling on it I want free shipping
1,"Why have all my orders disappeared from the app, it's shows in a browser but this app when logged in shows I've never ordered anything. I ordered more than 100 items this year."
3,"Please make this app more fluent and smoother to use. Also if possible, please add a dark mode to the app, eBay has had it for a couple of years now."
1,The app is stuck on some kind of Lord of the Rings advertisement loop and it won't stop or close. There's no way to stop it or get passed it to do any shopping.
1,I kept on searching up what I wanted to get and it won't bring up that specific item this thing is overpriced as well for a child's costume is $50 and for a medium is 80 to 100 dollars so Amazon is overpriced and it won't search up specific things
3,"App is improving, but now they started pushing notifications about the prime video. I don't care about the NFL games. Let the prime video app handle that, but not a shopping app."
2,New app update does not let you take screenshots!!! It claims there is personal information even though it's YOURS even when it isnt visible in the screenshot. All out ban as if amazon is a banking app. I am uninstalling the app and you should too. Just shop on the website where you still have the freedom to take screenshots and there is absolutely nothing jeff bezos can do about it.
3,I've tried everything to get back onto my account on a new phone (password included) and I had to get a notification on my phone even if I use two-step verification. I love the app tho
1,"They can't seem to leave the filter alone, have to change things up every few months right after you get used to the layout."
1,"Placed 2 orders online yesterday via desktop, but neither are showing up yet in the app...strange. Spotify reacts between desktop and mobile in real time, this seems to not react at all..."
1,"CAN'T CLOSE THE APP, CAN'T MOVE TO ANY OTHER APP, I CAN'T EVEN OPEN ANYTHING FROM THE DROP-DOWN LIST ON MY PHONE OR OPEN MY PHONES SETTINGS FROM IT SO I CAN FORCE CLOSE THE APP! I HAVE TO FORCE CLOSE MY PHONE & RESTART MY PHONE! 5 TIMES IVE TRIED! I'VE JUST BOUGHT £1K OF RING ALARM & LIGHTS ETC SO YOU CAN HAVE ALL THAT SENT BACK AS WELL! I'VE NOW UNINSTALLED THE APP! I'VE ALSO JUST GONE ONLINE & CLOSED MY AMAZON ACCOUNT! I NEEDED TO ORDER SOME STUFF SO LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE SHOPPING ELSEWHERE!"
1,"I get error pages 80% of the time. No matter what phone I use, what version I use, what area I'm in, the network I'm on... the app just doesn't work."
1,"Ordered over a week ago, unusual waiting time, no option to ask any questions about my item, it says delayed in transit, or probably stolen in transit I don't know, Amazon is becoming rubbish it seems."
2,messed up the app again. makes it really hard to go to different categories. you have to wonder when they had something so simple to use they wanted to make it harder
1,"Application is good enough but delivery agents are not amazon staff, and they just dont do proper attempts to deliver items on time or in proffecional way. Have no qulity control or even code of ethics / conduct using thier personal old cars and shipments dumps in the car."
1,"I try to buy music, my card is up to date, and still won't go through. It takes me on a loop. I can't even find a way to buy digital series... This place sucks!"
2,"I hate the new changes to the android app. CS wasn't even aware it had changed when I called. Either let me customize the shortcuts or put ""my orders"" at the top for quick access please"
1,Stupid non skippable ads when launching the app. Take it down please. I don't give a crab about your show when I try to shop. Show that ads somewhere else like in a print video app.
1,Can't sort or filter by country of origin. Otherwise decent customer service and quality support when reachable.
1,Even though it's unchecked Amazon Day Delivery is still my preferred delivery method and I don't want this option anymore. I regret every inputting a preferred day. Now it's an extra step to order 2 day delivery.
1,"Wth happened to the ""condition"" filter . Unistalled and reinstalled the app and the filter is nowhere to be found. Why are you guys screwing this up so bad!!?"
1,Keeps telling me oops no internet but have internet. I've tried uninstalling and reinstall but the same thing happens. I've tried to clear cache and uninstall and reinstall still says same thing.
1,"Stop auto playing a giant video upon launching the app. Not only is it annoying, it uses data. Bad design! Uninstalled."
1,"Prime day is pretty disappointing. Amazon is Full of 3rd party scam products and stuff not legal to sell in the USA. Their chatbot is the worst, let me talk to a real person. No price protection on any purchases."
1,I dont buy on amazon often but when i do they consistantly deliver my packages late. Normally idgaf but i paid for one day shipping and now its been a week and everyday the estimated delivery date gets moved to the next day. Also no way to get refunded for the expidited shipping they didnt honor. Maybe dont post a shipping date if you cant garentee it will arove by then. Just saying
1,"How many steps do you need to take to find ""Your orders"" tab? You'd assume it would be listed on the shortcuts, apparently the only shortcut listed is for ""buy again"" and ""Prime""."
1,I can't believe that a shopping app not available on Android 7 anymore you must be joking 😃😃😃 I understand Android 5 but Android 7 is still usable for many people that can't afford a newer smartphone.... Developers think before you do something stupid like that.... unbelievable....
1,I've never reviewed a product on amazon before and i submitted it and got an email a day later stating it doesn't go against the guidelines even though it was a positive i tried contacting a *support team* and they did nothing.
1,"ONE star, due to the fact that Notifications are REQUIRED with this app. (Readers, you're better off using a shortcut to the website [placed on your desktop] in lieu of using this app.)"
1,"I don't think people should order from here they're playing with 300$ and I still haven't gotten my packages they lost the first one and when I gave them a call the ""fixed it"" then when I called again the women who answered, hung up on me, like you wouldn't be frustrated if someone is playing with 300$ you spent???!?!??"
2,The only way I can buy anything related to prime video is through this app but now I cant even purchase movies it just tells me to watch the trailer. Why is it so hard to fix this app Amazon.
1,I loved the amazon prime approximately 3 years but when I got a new phone i I can't use the prime it says I have to add more items in order to get free shipping I've talked to few agents & have uninstalled and reinstalled it but still don't work
1,Amazon is going down hill for me anyway Today UPS delivered a package outside but I only got 1 of my 2 packages & they both said delivered & I did get 1 but the other they must of left and delivered it to another address I was looking everywhere for it and i shouldnt have to look for it but i do & they dont take pictures anymore so I paid for something I never received again this happens way to aften & now I have to try and get my money back & I did like Amazon but now not so much anymore
3,Used to use Amazon especially during peak COVID still did post but nowadays not really due to this new scheme with such huge price difference for prime members and non prime members! Living expenses are already so high and company like this just doesn't help by doing this.
1,Fails to get connection when trying to log in. Loads when skipping sign-in(briefly shows search results) and then claims to have no connection again. Useless
2,"Needs a dark mode, and the latest update broke EBT functionality. I hate Amazon but it's an unfortunately convenient need."
1,Latest update..can't find a way to search for free shipping or filter by free shipping. All the items in my buy later list are gone.
1,"I wish I could read Spanish, but I can't. Not sure why amazon switched languages on me and haven't had any luck trying to get back to English. Thank the Lord for google translate."
1,"Yet another app developed by brain-dead morons who think every user is a video-streaming fanatic. So the idiots at the programming trough made it so any video on the landing page of the app will AUTOPLAY!? Here's a tip for the developer dolts - not everyone has unlimited data on their device so your insistence on forcing autoplay videos in the app just shows how clueless, insipid and pathetic your ""braintrust"" is."
1,Constantly logs me out and demands I make a new password. Also extremely difficult to log out (if even possible) when needed.
1,For some reason I can't access my orders screen because it keeps loading I tried deleting the app signing back in and everything but I still can't access the orders page.this new update is not a good one.
1,"I cannot find parental controls for preventing in-app purchases. Amazon says the option is there, but it's not. Even worse product listings & reviews cannot be trusted. There is no recourse for the consumer."
1,Full page ads for some dumb Amazon TV show every time I open the app. No way to skip or block. Just shop elsewhere.
1,"Alexa, really!? Just plop that button directly on top of one of the most often used menu controls. You already own the world amazon, you don't need to be dicks about it"
1,"Not Good, you can no longer BUY kindle books through the App, you now have to go to the Amazon website.... Just a bit ridiculous. Might be time for a separate Kindle App!"
3,Outstanding orders? Too difficult to find. Small upgrade to sort on outstanding orders and update marketplace orders that have been delivered would be hugely beneficial. How do you update Shortcuts?
1,"Its expensive laggy and hard to understand, dosent show crusial information about products and has a overly long process of closing an account. Honestly just buy cheap china stuff somewhere Else."
1,Shopping app....UNLESS you want to purchase a kindle book. In which case you cannot. Because Google said NO! Really? Google gets to decide what a shopping app FOR A BOOK STORE can NOT sell you a BOOK?? Time to move Amazon app OFF google play!
5,"I quite love the app, I've never had a problem, yea there's a lot of very irrelevant items.... On my recommendations home page, other than that, everything is perfect, PLEASE ADD DARK MODE, MY EYES BEG OF YOUUUU 🥺🙏"
1,"I would rate negative 5 stars if i could. They banned my account over 1 month ago because of a problem with my credit card. Cannot talk to anyone helpfull to gain access to my account again. I only get directed to bots who send you the same unhelpfull information over and over again, AND they still took money out for my subsciptions i couldnt use or cansel ""because my account is on hold"" Shop Local, at least small business owners apreciate your business and care about their customers."
2,The app is really slow load up at the beginning. When you open it up you have to spend like 10mins waiting for it to load up.
5,"I need to go to AA. Amazoners Anonymous. I use this app WAY too much, because Amazon makes it too easy to find what I didn't even know I wanted. It's the one app that never fails. Unfortunately for my wallet, that is."
1,Latest update needs to be redone! I can't add anything to my cart anymore!!! Guess Amazon doesn't want me to keep spending my money with them!
1,"Just when u think hard core incompetence cant get any worse, Amazon proves u wrong, now when u request a replacement for a damaged item they default and ship to a difrent address , not even giving u even the option to ship it to default address or original shipped to address, trying to fix issues over phone 5 reps no help just further aggravation, u cant make stuff like this up, level of incopetence even if u tryd, and comming from Amazon not some 3 month 5 employee startup its inexcusable"
1,Order and then cancel my order and called my card all my money was gone. Never ever will I buy anything from there. Costumer service sucks basically laugh when I was talking to her. Be professional if you don't want to hear it find a different job. YOUR JOB IS TO HELP NOT MOCK PEOPLE. I ask for supervisor and basically she said he wouldn't be able to help me.**ALSO APP GLITCH WHEN TRYING TO LOOK AT ITEM ************* The other lady was very nice kinda help me a little bit. She's amazing.
2,"I no longer get notifications for my delivery & i have it set.. i get notifications for new merchandise... i have erased app & downloaded again, reset settings- still no notification... whats happening?..."
1,"One of the worst customer services. As long as you get your delivery on time great. But if you need to talk to anyone to get an updated time because of their screw up, then just forget it."
1,Wont let you use the web browser I hate this app I hate shopping on it I literally only use it for whole foods but it's not even worth it because when I want to use the web browser it takes over my web browser and refuses to let me use Amazon web browser so once more I'm deleting this useless app
4,"Decent stuff, decent price, they make it easy to buy things hard to get a hold of someone with authority to fix problems that can occur, and they like to try n give you prime when you don't ask for it."
3,There is so much 'promoted' stuff that you always see the same items on every page of your search. The app works well.
1,"Slow, clunky and ugly. So very ugly. I also can't ask questions so that's fun, thanks Amazon. I have no idea what I'm buying and customers can't help."
2,"Used to be a perfectly fine working app, now I can't even track my shipments anymore 'cos the map doesn't load up properly - as far as i'm concerned that was the best working feature of this app"
4,love this app but everytime my neighbor orders something it gets sent to my house even though their address is on the package. So confused on why drivers can't deliver to the right address
1,Shortcuts are great but can't add to them and now have to tap through multiple options to view orders.
1,"Dark mode ? Literally the only app on earth without dark mode. Use my phone and everything is dark mode...then open amazon and it destroys my eyes its so bright. Its not good or strong branding, the only branding association i have is 'oh no I have to open that app'"
1,"Take the splash screen ad off. You app took too long, and was buggy before. Don't borrow problems. We are not a captive audience."
2,"New updates just made more problems. Super slow to open, closes randomly, search terms don't work as well."
4,More details does not work for sometime now. The text button when clicked changes but the text area does not expand to show additional text.
2,Can't even open the orders page or my returns so when I'm at a place to make a return I'm standing there waiting forever for it to give me my orders. The app is very cumbersome.
1,"Does not work at all, immediately crashes on loading. Installed as the ""Shop Amazon"" app on the kindle is no longer supported! 1 star is generous!"
3,I'm trying to view my recent orders be 1 is defective an it's only flashing not allowing me to click on that item. Been doing this for several months now when ever I want to see old orders
1,"Unskippable ads? I'm a paid member, I don't want to have to watch ads when opening the app, especially for something I've already paid for!"
1,Hate the Amazon service. Everytime I buy something with same day delivery it gets delayed a day or two. Don't offer this service if you can't fulfill it!
1,Seriously? A forced ad on app launch. I've been thinking about canceling my Prime membership (15 years or so?) - this might be the nail.
3,"Why has this app gotten slower after every update!! I have a s21 Samsung, so not a slow phone. I'm a regular user and shop frequently but lately it's been frustrating 😕"
1,"First time using this app.. I need to use it to pick up and order from a locker, and IT WILL NOT LOAD, so therefore I cannot pick up my package, which contains my daughter's homecoming dress. This app sucks."
1,I can't believe this app is crashing each time I try to change currency unit. Shame. It's a huge brand. Very disappointed
4,Ive scored this app 5 stars why? Because simply to my opinion its the best shopping app. Everything you need Amazon has it for us.Thank you amazon for allowing us to be apart of the shopping online conveince for all.
1,"Love and hate, I shop on Amazon but for whatever reason this app has been running so bad its almost unusable. Not sure if it was an update or what but I hope it improves. Hasnt always been this bad"
5,A great easy to use app for Amazon and emergency Morrisons if needed. I only wish that I came with a biometric login each time you open it for added security.
2,The new video adds that pop up when opening the app are super annoying. Enough is enough with this invasion!
1,The app loads very slowly and the only way for me to contact customer support because I have a problem with my orders is by getting on this app that I cannot do on the website
2,Your app has a bug I can't do anything on it and my phone keeps force closing it because of the problem. Has my recent order also been affected because of this problem?
5,I love this app it's easy to see everything u need to know about the status of your Amazon account and very easy to order anything anytime and customer service is also outstanding
1,Should be 0 star. My account was put on hold and they said the only thing they could do was close my account. Now I can't create a new account because my phone number and email where on the account. Amazon Sucks.
1,The app is not working at all for me for the past 3 or 4 wks. It just says something is wrong. I cant search old orders place new ones. Thing.
1,"Continually stops working. Message received is ""oops something went wrong on out part"". Worked better prior to updates. Whatever you paid developer was way to much, they fid an awful job"
1,Dito to all of the above! I kept wondering why I have had problems trying to place orders. GUESS WHAT AMAZON? I don't want or need anything enough to put with this kind of frustration!
3,"Needs user customisation. When I open my shortcuts I don't care about ""Prime Reading"" or ""Amazon Devices"". I want my orders back at the top, where they used to be!"
1,"Paying prime, ordering a paket that should come next day, arrives 4 days later. In cahoot with wish, ordered some product, product arives in 3 weeks, samw thing on wish 3x cheaper No same day deliveries. And some products with prime cost x amount of money. Same product with shipping on NO amazon cost exactly the same... Diagrace"
1,"This is bad.. my item is still later sould have arrived the 20 September 2022. All they say is. ""We are sorry for that your item is late.. fedEx was not late with my first item. But now its UPS that is delivering and they are late"
3,"When Amazon makes a mistake they want you to return the item before receiving refund or the item you requested. Amazon's mistake, why do I have to put forth extra energy for Amazon's mistake"
1,"We have always been using Amazon for company purchases but in the last week we have see prices hiked across Amazon 30%+ and we won't do our buying at such a premium. I guess it's time for a change anyway. Thanks Amazon, we'll keep watching to see if you change your ways."
1,"Something has gone very wrong with your search perimeters. Nothing even close to what I'm looking up, comes up. It's pages and pages of ""suggestions"". No thank you"
4,There is no option to sign out. I don't like the echo button. There seems to be less items offered in the app than on the website.
1,"Packages Never get delivered on time and it's always an excuse or apology but that doesn't help me get my items I ordered. I'm tired of it. And the delivery people lies and say they attempted to deliver and they didn't. Imagine if I ordered something important. This is unacceptable and if this is the type of company and guarantee I get from Amazon and being a prime member, I don't want it. This should be rectified and it hasn't been. All I got was a BS apology"
4,"Nice and easy to use upto now But since the recent update I have to go searching to find my orders, I used to be on your shopping basket, please put it back to where it was Amazon."
1,They listed my account as abandoned. Called customer service and they instructed me to make a new account with same info and i am perpetually locked out. Poor service for a subpar app.
1,I can't even start to shop before it crashes 10 seconds before crashing is about the best I can get at this point.
1,Forced updates are not cool. Would be nice to be able use app without having the Google play store open up and force an update to use the Amazon shopping app... Not cool.
2,They removed most features from the app and made them website exclusive yet when you try to access the website of mobile phone they take you to that section of the app and it says this feature is unavailable in mobile app
5,My #1 favorite app but i wish i didn't have to have it downloaded because I'm able to access it through the Klarna app...it an extra app/storage on my phone. Can you guys fix this please otherwise totally awesome
1,"Went from good too bad. I can no longer shop for ""used or previously owned in app. You can still find these items but not by directly searching for them."
2,I extremely dislike the influencer videos that hamper the use of the app. There needs to be a way to turn off these videos.
5,"I had only good experience with shopping here. Also, when I needed help, I had a very kind, quick, helpful assistant Igor in chat."
1,Doesn't let you control notifications from Android. The app is also just incredibly terrible. It's like whoever makes this app has never even seen a smart phone before and they're just blindly writing code based on a vague description they got from a coworker.
1,"Annoying ad when opening the app, eating data (doesn't matter if it's a small amount) eating away at my time. Did i say Annoying ad when opening the app 🤬🤬🤬"
1,This used to be a great app but now it just hangs when I try to look at order history among other things. This comes at about the same time as the disastrous 'upgrade' to Android 13. Coincidence?
1,"Hit with a full screen Rings of Power ad every time I open the app. Get lost already, I don't want to watch your stupid show."
2,Constantly changing to Spanish. Other than the fact I can't read it and have to constantly change it...the app is fine
1,your app no longer works on older Samsung devices. You will lose business because of this lack of support for those who cannot afford to keep upgrading their devices.
1,This app sucks everytime i buy anything from amazon it is delayed by 3 days I got prime and nothing changed I have to wait 6 days just get a computer mouse don't waste your time on this app just get the walmart app or something else atleast with walmart I can just drive there and pick it up in the same day I ordered it
1,"I'm kinda upset I wanted a return on items because of a verification that I already signed in but already did and spent 400 dollars 3 times very disappointed, the new 4 digit thing is very pissing. But won't let me get my money back in return."
3,The search bar willl clear out the text when i try to paste after typing. So i cant type part of a search and past the rest. Super annoying.
4,"Its a decent app, got alot of stuff for sale, its a bit confusing learning how to navigate your subscriptions but if you can do that this apps pretty cool, got an exho dot 3rd gen for 10 bucks lmao"
2,Needs a dark mode desperately. Search results are extremely bad and show way too many things that aren't even related to what I searched for.
1,I return an item and they have received the package and every time I get an contact with chat or calling customer service they don't help they said to wait 5 days for refund then 14 days now its pass 14 days and they came up that's 30 days for refund I have never had this issue before now it's an issue because it shows on a video they have on Amazon app that a soon they receive package they refund it's processes right away I need this resolved now
1,Frustrated! I CANNOT log in at all because my phone number has changed and there is no way for me to change it without logging in! I have a $20 gift card and can't use it!
1,Was fine app till update. Can not buy now can only add to cart. Add to cart tab is the only option. The buy now tab us gone. What us going on???!!!!!
1,I am currently living in Spain. But I cannot select amazon Spain because I need the English version so I get transfered to Amazon UK. Extremely disappointed.
1,the chat bot should be illegal. Most useless tool I've ever seen. Might be time to switch back to ebay. What a nightmare. 400.00 LOST IN SHIPPING with no way to report it. Thank Amazon......
1,"The my orders section has gone really buggy, sometimes opens after a few minutes other time and more often than not its the oh o message with the image of the dog. please fix this"
3,"I enjoy the app but it keeps disappearing from my phone for some reason. Every time I have to come back here and tap the ""enable"" button"
2,The app works. It does not obey dark mode setting. The user interface is mediocre. No tablet layout...
1,"The worst customer service which I ever have. You always talk with the robots, and if your case is not in the robot scripts you simply cannot solve it. There just will never options to talk with a human."
1,What happened to the 1 click buy option. There is just an add to cart option. Not finding a way to just purchase one item.
5,Pastor D. Lee I actually like shopping with Amazon it's convenient and I find most of the things that I want and 90% of the time I get a great price I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested
4,"I love the app & never had a problem with it. Always find what I am looking for. But for the love of God, please make DARK MODE an option‼️ I'm sick of being blinded every time I open the app."
1,"Cannot contact customer service or submit ticket. When clicking on any issue such as replace item due to defects, it goes to main web page instead of customer service."
1,Import charges makes Amazon not worth using. They should get a warehouse in South Africa and ombat these import charges. Things are 30% more expensive then what you would pay in the US
3,Why can't move multiple selected items in a wish list to another wish list conveniently which is a very basic needed feature. Can't notify delivery items from Echo Dot Premium!
2,"Easy to buy stuff, difficult to find the charges so I can reconcile with my cc statement. Often get double charged for tv stations."
1,Every time I open the app I'm now forced to watch a teaser for rings if power. I don't care about your garbage show stop getting in my way when I'm trying to shop.
1,"Package tracking is downright mediocre. Thing arive early, and it is never updated when I check my order list."
1,"More garbage compliments of google play and Amazon. Can't just shop and purchase items. No, oh no....have to play games and jump through hoops. Ridiculous"
3,"App is good, for some reason I'm unable to open my 'your orders' tab. Whenever I click on the app just freezes."
1,"Hello dear Developers, I need a little bit help. I'm from Bangladesh and trying to sign up for Amazon account but I cannot get verification OTP SMS on my mobile phone but email verification everytime done. For long time I am waiting for OTP SMS but many times I am fail to sign up in Amazon account please help me it's very urgent. Thanks in advance"
1,"What is this Ads of Lord of the Rings when I open the app, purchase alot of items on this app, please don't start being like other companies and have full of ads."
2,"When is Amazon Ireland going to be added to the app? The new depot in Dublin has been open 2 months now. Can't buy anything of amazon, especially from the UK with the ridiculous import charges."
1,Video ads keep taking over and can't be closed when I open the app and I have prime. Absolutely ridiculous!
1,"For the past few days I have ordered items and I've had no notification, stating where my parcel was or how long they'll be. This has happened 3 times now"
1,"Switched to espanol. For some reason, this app has changed my default language from English to Spanish which has rendered it useless."
1,"Terrible app, has literally no customer service, you will just be put on an endless loop of links that never give you any contact information."
1,"You have got my app in Spanish!!!! I did not do this or mess it up in any way!! I tried to call customer Service but wouldn't speak to me!! Because they didn't have enough Proof that it was me! What a heartening feeling not being able to prove who you are and denied access to your account you've been using for years. Terrible Customer Service!!! With my Email, phone number, Adress, all my info and still would not trust me! You guys are Terrible! Now my app is in Spanish and don't know ho"
1,"Instead of me checking amazon for my secirity, amazon is holding me and my debit card for security reasons. I am astonished to see. I am trying for the last 72 hours ( 3 days ) but as i am from paskistan, this means i going to loot amazon. And so cannot do shopping from them. So sad."
5,It's just wonderful being a Amazon custom and they work with you when things don't show up to your door on time they help you they're very patient and understanding and I just love to talk to anyone that I get on the phone have an awesome time
5,"I Absolutley LOVE using this app to navigate my way thru amazon. I havent had any problems or became frustrated by anything. Smooth sailimg so.far.knock on wood, lol."
4,"I would recommend this app for shopping. However one complaint I would like to address is that it is very hard to change your language in the app because the settings don't make it clear. You can't change your language back to English if you looked at a page from a different country and you can't change it back unless if you say ""Alexa, change my language"" or if you log out and sign back in. Changing a laguange shouldn't be this hard for the app, and the Options layouts need to be fixed."
1,"This app keeps opening up in Spanish, and I am English speaking. And there is nothing that I can find to help me switch it back to English"
2,Every time they send me notification supposedly on my phone number it doesn't occur. Then your representatives tells me it would be in your app. I go to your app and it shows me nothing but pictures of videos of a trilogy. Some representatives can't even help me because they tell me to go to my phone number and it's not there. I can't even hook up Alexa because of this problem.
2,"I can't scroll through products in my lists. When I try, the page moves back up in a jitter-like fashion. Also, you can only add notifs for items you recently searched for and not other products. You have to manually search for each item you want a notif for and then go back to the notifs tab and add them individually. Should have a search function added to the notifs tab. Recently can't contact customer service. Used chat and no one responded back. Tried call and connected but no one on line"
1,"The app keeps breaking when trying to view my orders. It always shows an error message ""something went wrong on our end"" it's so hard to want to purchase items if I can't see the status of my orders"
3,"I can't see any of the used options on here anymore. Sometimes it'll show refurbished and when you click on it you'll see there's used options available. Click for more details and it just kicks you back to the details of the item. Even looking thru my lists I can't see used options... Please fix. Wait, somethings I can see used on but not all.. It's kind of glitch. And it's now rare for me to see my orders. I always get an error message. Lot of glitches..."
3,Where is the dark mode? It's 2022! I have a Galaxy 21+ running on Android 12 with dark mode enabled. The Amazon app is brighter than the sun.
2,It was when used to be really good because you could buy everything off of there for there but now on the Amazon app I can't even buy my kindle stories and that really sucks because now I have to go all the way to the main website once I get out of my kindle app no app just so I can get the next story or because there's a new story that I want to read instead of just buying it off with the Amazon regular shopping app
2,"Wow. Ok so item search is clogged with sponsored items that are not what I want, not interested in, and actively make it harder to find what I want to buy. Alexa controls do not hide when Alexa is Inactive. Photo controls do not hide and block my ability to scroll through products. New color is bright and lacks night mode option. Thanks for helping me use Amazon less."
1,"Can't but a kindle book. If I go to the web browser, it auto opens in the app. Where you can't but kindle books"
1,New filtering system is horrible. You cannot sort by low to high price anymore.
2,This is the second time that I've had to uninstall this app & reinstall it because it's in Spanish when I open it in only 2 weeks The same thing has happened to my husband as well 2 weeks ago. We've never used it in Spanish ever so please fix this glitch because we love Amazon & we order from y'all every week & multiple times a week. It's just very irritating when I cannot read it & have to take the extra time to fix. I would normally give Amazon a five star rating but this needs to be fixed.
5,Srill love Amazon after all of these years!!!! The only real and trusted place to get my children's school books since they are both homeschoolers; also the prices are cheaper then what I use to pay when buying them 2nd hand.
3,"We were good Amazon, until you took away my ability to buy my kindle books through ANY of your apps. A lot times my browser doesn't want to load, and I never leave myself logged in to any of my accounts or save my passwords. Your apps, this one and the Kindle app, were the only places I could easily buy your books. If I didn't have 100 plus books already I'd switch."
3,sick of seeing that stupid popup forst thing for lors of the rings. that should only.be advertised in the prime video app as that is a streaming movie/tv show. also so annoying if an item is to be delayed I shouldn't have to login on a desktop website to approve the delay.
2,I finally dropped Amazon y'all and it is amazing! Walmart ships free 2 day when you spend over 35 and no extra fees! Amazon is basically bloatware now. Break free y'all!
1,"Instructions provided were to 'Leave behind wheelie bin'; NOT 'Side Gate'. Items have been thrown over the side gate and hit the ground/step, sustaining damage."
1,"Besides navigating through endless cheaply made and counterfeit junk, it's extremely difficult when you have a PO Box because USPS that doesn't deliver to residential address and UPS, FedEx, Amazon delivery doesn't deliver to PO Office Box. When Amazon provides the option to pick their carrier to ship items, maybe I'll buy more often on Amazon."
5,Love Amazon. We almost had to cancel my subscription they would not let me in but I called and we worked it out. But I was really upset. So happy I got back into my account. Thank you
1,"My worst experience with a shop... Pre ordered Pixel 7 and they canceled the order after 12 days of waiting (shipped by amazon) due to a ""technical error"". Never pre order things on Amazon"
2,"Love Amazon hate the app, every time I going to check on my products or whatever that I'm waiting on it doesn't have the app anymore it's uninstalled why is that? But then when you're on the app it's so slow and acts as if there's not enough signal to load the page each time I press the button to go to a different page use your friendly sort of it's simple but it's so slow and it's glitchy that you don't even want to use it but that going online is better."
1,"The new set up is awful, hard to find what I'm looking for, and at these prices I expect not to have Wish level quality of product."
1,"Stupid lord of the rings promotion pops up every time you open the app. Who puts forced full screen pop-up ads on a shopping app? You cannot use the app without watching a 10 second lord of the rings ad every time you open it, the ad cannot be skipped and every time you close the app you're redirected to the lord of the rings promotion page"
3,"For the past month, every time that I open the app, the language is Spanish. I do not speak Spanish! I did not change the language setting, so I'm at a loss as to how this happened. I've tried everything. I've restarted my phone several times hoping it would revert back to English, to no avail. I have now uninstalled the app THREE times, and reinstalled it. When I initially open up the app, it's in ENGLISH, only to find that it has reverted BACK to Spanish a few hours later. 🤬🤬🤬"
2,"Service is terrible. They trap you into prime with promises of facilities like primeday. In practice the service is completely unpredictable. Items do not arrive on schedule, sometimes they arrive ahead of time, and sometimes they get delayed over a week. The worst part is day after day they reschedule and you are stuck waiting to receive the delivery!"
1,"When I started using the app it was good it didn't have any problems but lately it has been doing weird stuff like taking Amazon prime from me, or when I checked my orders I had none, and the app has been very slow and just doesn't really work well, I prefer using the Amazon web"
1,"I've had a lot of positive experiences with Amazon but the bad experiences outweigh. I never received a package and hundreds of messages back and forth and hours on the phone with various customer service nothing was ever handled. For months I was strung along waiting for call backs and ""investigations."" Customer service was always sympathetic but never actually did anything. I sat on the phone with someone for 3 hours only for them to tell me they'd get it worked out and nothing."
4,Pretty good. But most the time it says next day if ordered by a certain time . Then they send update that it's delayed 3 or 4 days. And I paid prime for this...
1,it change my location to UK instead of Brazil. It deleted ALL of my items in my wish list! I'm SO disappointed
1,"App still not working since June 2022... Ive tried all the steps that Amazon recommendeds on how to fix issues with there app and nothing has worked. I've even tried multiple times to clear cache & data and uninstalling and reinstalling the app but no luck... The app seems to load then immediately shows the picture of the dog and says ""oh-no, something went wrong on our end"" I've had no option but to use the web browser to access Amazon, and of course I have found no way to get help!!!"
2,Pretty good most of the time. Not a fan of the new advert for LoTR that shows every time you open the app!
1,"No way to get rid of the alexa button, no way to edit alexa settings, not even by following the instructions. Impossible to clean up recommended lists. Constantly refreshes and you lose your place. Photos don't load. Videos don't load. Surveys cast votes just by scrolling past, no pics or text, so I don't even know what I accidentally voted on."
1,"Hasn't worked since last update - as soon as I open it I get the message ""Something has gone wrong our end"". Been using it for years prior to this without issue - hope they fix it soon. Update: Dev - please advise. Update: Still not working after latest update wigh same ""somthhing has gone wrong our end"" message. Update: with every update things get worse - last two updates are unusable, crashes, freezes, pictures of dogs, etc. Amazon - get some real android devs!!"
3,Overall not bad but some of the Seller's could use more scrutiny because a lot of them don't even have possession of the items and when they sell an item more than once of something at the price and then all of a sudden they don't have it they'll trick you by giving you someone else's shipping information and stringing you along for 2 weeks. frankly if you don't have the item in hand you don't need to be allowed to be a seller you should have to prove it by the serial number and model number
3,"Reviews have improved from many being fraudulent and lots for the wrong product. I always start with 1 star reviews and go up. Deliveries are good to bad, with some blame goin to UPS. They now want Returns In the delivery container, hope I remember. Customer service is good. The absolute worst part of shopping here is Amazon promotes products when you search for a product. They throw in unrelated products to get your interest and purchase. I go to eBay when I have trouble finding some product"
1,"Ads in your app? I pay for a service from you, not like I'm receiving the service for free, Lord of The Rings ad upon opening the app, freaking stup*d. We pay for service not for ads"
2,"Great, but some really bad bugs. This has happened multiple times, and it ruins the entire app. I'll order something, say it's shipping, and 4 days later it says ""revise payment method"". I just recently ordered someone a gift and I needed it on a Monday, it said it would ship Monday, so I forgot about it and moved on. That Monday came, and I woke up to a notification saying ""order cancelled, revise payment method."" FOUR DAYS LATER??"
2,Was able to finally sample music again until this last update. Now it wont even let me purchase mp3 music on my device
1,Very poor service very bad quality please don't buy from this app not refund money and gift voucher as for in 7days refund money but they are return goods but not refunded voucher or money lot of time I contact Amazon customer they are told in 24 hours refund your blanc but never refund please take care in the world people very very poor bad app Amazon shopping my experience
1,"New versions of this app do not work on my phone, and when I have the old versions installed, it is now blocked with an ""update now"" screen where I cannot use the app. there needs to be options for people whose phones can't handle the updates, but they still want the convenience of using the app on their phone!"
3,"Good app. Lately it has been changing the language to Spanish on it's own, please fix this. I would rather not have to uninstall and reinstall it everytime it changes languages on me. (Yes i have tried changing the language back manually, never stays in English. And no it's not my phone settings changing it.)"
1,"App is using random payment methods, not the selected default one. PLEASE FIX THIS! It's been doing it for months"
1,"Was good until last update!! Now everything in my lists is pushed to one side, I can't watch any videos, I have to restart my phone in order to get it to even load my orders, lists and account!! Some of the buttons don't work!! I've been using this app for years and it's never been this bad!!"
1,"Being a prime member doesn't mean squat to Amazon. I ordered 4 items in 2 separate orders. 2 items weren't delivered to my door and I was told to wait and was made to feel like I did something wrong even though I included delivery instructions. The other 2 items I tried to cancel, but only 1 was. But an authorization for both stayed on my account until they shipped the 1 item and now I'm missing the amount for the other. All I'm given is customer service that passes me off and tells me to wait."
3,Got an obnoxious lord of the rings ad that prevented me from using the app for a few seconds. Not a fan. Made me not want to use amazon any more.
4,I can't view my orders at all. I've tried everything and still can't see it. The app tries to load but eventually it says something went wrong.
5,Amazon shopping is awesome Because has sale for anything best deals for the good price! And like for example if you want to get your yourself a atsc 3.0 next gen converter box like the HD home run like the best deal the price will shrink on the HD home run if you purchase it up on Black Friday or Cyber Monday!
1,I pay for Prime 2 day shipping but most deliveries take between 5 to 10 days to get here. Unacceptable!
3,App has order page issues. Rarely loads the orders page correctly within the app. Gets stuck in a cycle/refreshing the page before displaying.
1,It shuts down as soon as I go to open it. Makes my phone glitch out. I didn't have this problem until I went to redownload it.
1,"How dare you force me to watch an unskippable ad for your stupid show before browsing the app. I pay for prime, not for ads. I don't want prime video, your shows are beyond awful. I don't want prime now, I don't want prime pantry. I pay for free shipping when in reality I'm paying for shipping in advance. You take up have my computer screen autoplaying this show, now the app?"
1,I am seriously considering removing the app. Now it keeps popping up an advert for Amazon prime when I open it. I have Amazon prime already. The add freezes the app for a while. It's very frustrating. Especially since I have prime already. An when I complain they do nothing. Poor customer service.
1,"Just started up with these annoying ads when I open the app. If I can't figure out how to stop it I am closing my account I get enough ads all over the place. Stop it, cause it's a guaruntee the whole ountry is gonna go elsewhere rather than be inundated with your crummy ads"
1,"I have over 200 apps on my phone, all works well except Amazon, cannot even go to the login page, and it takes forever."
1,"So slow to load and also I can now only see a few of my orders, I can't keep scrolling to see older orders to maybe reorder or leave a review."
1,"It was a good app before this past update. Now the app won't open. I keep getting ""app unresponsive "" errors then it forces itself closed"
2,"App works fine and it's easy to buy stuff. However only giving 2 stars because what you get for the cost of prime (plus they just raised rates to steal more money from people during hard times, very Democrat of them) isn't worth the cost. Prices of products are inflated to compensate for the free shipping so you are literally paying shipping twice if you have a prime account. Plus they do nothing to prevent fraudulent purchasing with stolen credit cards."
1,"Feels sluggish, unresponsive at times, backstack doesn't work as expected. I shop on Amazon through my phone a lot and would like a fully native experience without webviews. Also should add feature to search text like Ctrl + F in browsers so I can easily find keywords in product's descriptions."
1,Annoying notifications - doesn't seem to be any way to pick which notifications you'd like to recieve and its an all or nothing deal. I've turned them all off because I'm sick of being prompted to review items and they've now started using notifications to deliver product recommendations (advertising). No thanks.
1,"Unfortunately the app has two major faults, 1)it has become bloated with information I'm not interested in which makes it incredibly tedious to use. Lists, recommendations, things I have no interest in being pushed. 2) Amazon won't let me use it for Kindle books and Kindle will not let me buy books off Paperwhite because I'm in the wrong country even after changing settings. Fubared."
5,"Failure. I love Amazon! The thug is though that the filters aren't working and that leaves thousands of items that aren't what I'm looking for. Will you please correct this issue. P.S. I did sign and back in, deleted the Amazon app and I have restarted my phone but it's still not working properly. 😕"
3,"Any time I find an item that happens to be in a different language than the one I normally speak, and I click on that item, the app switches the entire language of the app to match the item's language. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to finally fix the issue this round. Sometimes I can find where they hide the language preferences, but if I back up at all, it switches again."
1,"Ordered a large picture frame. It cost over 1/4th of my paycheck. Said it was delivered, so I looked outside. Not there. It was delivered to someone else in another town. I tried to get a hold of them ended up talking to a robot. I wanted at least a refund, but I couldn't do that without returning the picture frame, which I don't have. I hate giving negative reviews, but this isn't the first time it has happened on other accounts. If I could give 0 stars I would."
2,"The last forced app update made it so you can no longer see the next upcoming order shipment. Which is particularly problematic if you are waiting on a shipment or order multiple things, everything gets buried now. It also takes more clicks just to check order status, which requires you to now wait for more pages to load first. The last version was working fine and these changes break the entire point of why I started to use it"
2,"9 months on and the tracking us still hopeless - why does the map flash on screen then vanish??? Desperately needs updating. Useful app in general to shop, but parcel tracking often fails to show the map. It flashes by, and is instantly hidden by the utterly unhelpful update summary. Sometimes it works perfectly, but about 70% of the time it fails which is frustrating. Please fix this bug."
2,"This app gets worse with each update. It shouldn't be so much trouble to access your orders. Even worse, the app USED to show your orders in the order that they were scheduled to arrive, now it shows them in the order that you ordered. As a customer that makes a lot of pre-orders of items coming out in the future, the new order layout STINKS. Its like Amazon enjoys making the app less helpful."
5,I really like this app and use it a lot!!! Easy to manage and they send reminders if you put something on your list and it goes up or down in price. They have a list of items you buy regularly you can straight to. It sure saves you time. Very convenient and helpful app.
2,"I used to really love Amazon. Good quality stuff at reasonable prices. But, in the past 2 years they've allowed ad manipulation by off-brand manufacturers to get so bad that I have to scroll for several pages before I see anything of quality that I recognize. The two stars are because the app works nearly flawlessly (good job, devs!). The minus 3 is for the company putting profit over quality."
4,"Much improved, cleaner, more efficient, greater relevance, push adds greatly diminished. Some navigation still a little awkward, common tasks (tracking and order status) can still require too mush navigation. One suggestion: Order combination or edit prior to shipment. This would reduce email notifications."
5,"I am physically challenged and I don't go to stores so I rely a lot on Amazon for purchases of everyday items. I utilize Subscribe and Save very much since the extra savings is worth it to me on a limited budget. I can find specific items and a wide variety of choices on household items, personal care items, electronics and more. I'm thankful this option exists. I also use Amazon Smile where a portion of every sale goes to a charity of my choice. The app is up to date."
1,"I have two accounts. We shop on my husband's account with prime membership, but every time I log into that account it logs me out of my kindle app and I lose all my downloads. I called customer service and they say there's no way to merge the two accounts or fix the logging-out problem. This really should have been better thought- through. :("
3,"could be better. The choice to remove search by category in the mobile app is really frustrating. I have to revert to use the desktop website to be able to browse the categories I am interested in. Also, the red App Badge shows ""1"" notification, but there seems to be nothing in the app, and I can't make it go away. Using the website is a much better experience, would be good to have a good experience on the go too, but the mobile app is just meh."
3,"I would give it 5 stars if the app wouldn't freeze up, and just crash 80% of the time. Hopefully they will fix it sometime this year. I uninstalled it, they can have it. My advice to y'all would be don't waste your time, use the space on your phone for something that works.."
1,"Over the weekend the app started showing in Spanish on its own. Now, if I read Spanish I could use the app to change the language. I of course can't I called customer support. They said my language preferences were indeed English. The Android app just be having issues. They'd have someone fix it. Today, a few days later, the app was still in Spanish. I found a menu ""idioma"" that wasn't there before. I changed my language. Now, the billion dollar company didn't actually fix my bug."
1,Buggy. Used to show an almost blank white screen when loaded. I had to trick it into working (eg minimise and then maximise). Now on loading it shows me an advert for Amazon Prime even though I'm signed up already. The Continue Shopping button does not work. Again you have to trick it into working.
1,"Something is wrong with this app on Android. You can't add anything to the cart. It always says something went wrong. I have to use ""buy now"" for every single item. It's really annoying. The good thing is I won't buy as much since it's so hard to buy anything now. Terrible! On top of that, It always asks for the letter confirmation to ensure I'm human (Amazon needs to figure out how to protect against bad actors but not make the good customers jump through hoops)"
3,"it's OK, not great or anything. I prefer using the web version since it allows me to use my dark reader add on that makes it easier for me to see since I'm visually impaired, also saves on battery power. main thing I dont like is the app is ALWAYS on bright!"
1,"Having issues playing a bought movie on my TV. Other videos and shows play fine on the app. Movie plays on other devices. I uninstalled the app. Turned my roku TV off and on, with the same issues. I can't get ahold of anybody from Amazon."
1,"Needs update BADLY!! I keep getting notifications like ""Your package is one stop away, track it on a map now"" or ""free shipping, no minimum required"" and when I click on them....they disappear and show something COMPLETELY different. Also!!! PLEASE DO AWAY WITH EMAIL AND TEXT VERIFICATION FOR ACCOUNTS...ITS ANNPYING AND NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT CAPABILITY"
1,"Amazon keeps getting worse and worse. You get Amazon prime but then still need to pay more money to listen to music and watch certain movies, not to mention ads on the movies that came with prime. Prime is useless, packages come in 2 days anyway and the prices keep increasing for low quality goods. Get off this app, buy from smaller businesses."
5,"I love the Amazon Shopping App for my Android phone a lot. Amazon really is a great place to shop, manage my personal information, manage my Prime subscription/Services, and the ability to always find everything I'm looking for whatever the Personal, Seasonal, Events/Holiday, and much more! The App is working smoothly and is visually appealing and easy to use when searching, or navigating profile info"
1,"The app is fine. However, Amazon has started marking multiple deliveries as ""undeliverable"" on the morning they are supposed to be delivered, even while I am waiting, in person, for the delivery. Since you can't talk to customer service without wasting your whole day, and they apparently sell items they have no intention of delivering, I won't be using Amazon for anything anymore. Amazon is going downhill fast at this point."
1,"Would it really be that hard to allow Google voice to text on your app? Why is the voice recognition so horrible compared to Google? I thought the purpose of an app was to be a faster more simplified version of a web page, but this app is a much slower version of their web page and it gets worse with every update. Are y'all mining my data or something? Why does everything take so long to load? Why do you keep making the app more complicated?"
1,"The new layout is horrible to navigate thru. No more touch on the upper left corner and getting easy access to ""my orders"" to see what's still to be delivered. I make most of my purchases from my smartphone, why would you make it harder? Fix the App, fire the designers, or I'm going to delete the App and fire you Amazon!"
1,"THIS DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR CANADIANS. It recommends you use the chat function to resolve any order issues, but they can't actually help you if you purchased the product from Amazon Canada... even though the app lets you purchase from Amazon Canada. I downloaded and used the app to get a discount - which was great. I'll never use it again."
3,"Idk if a recent change has happened to this app but the quality has dropped drastically. It's very slow now, freeze's a lot, can't edit my list.... I'm just disappointed right now. I was excited for prime day but with the way the app is misbehaving I might just be waiting for Walmart Deals for Days in a few months."
1,I've been having a real problem with orders not arriving. And I noticed that my order may have been lost and I can request a refund but it won't let me request a refund so they need to stop posting that you can get one.. it is difficult to contact a live person. I want a phone number not to be made to download an app before I can try to contact someone. I buy a lot from Amazon but I may have to find a different place to shop because of the poor service I've been getting.
5,"I use this app for almost every thing I shop for. I don't leave the house very often so most of my Groceries come from Fresh and Whole Foods via the app, a little clothing, most home items I buy here, access literarure & music and of course Prime Video with extra channels to access there and much more. I can find almost everything on the app, sometimes elsewhere. Highly recommend it to any & all to try this at least once & you'll be hooked 😆"
1,"It became terrible as it's not possible to buy audio and Kindle book in this app any more. It's really hard to accept the company doesn't care about customers, only about not paying Google for the purchases made in app. Definitely, it's time to look for another app for audio and e-books...."
1,"This was a great but prime is expensive now and the TV has some stations the monthly cost is hidden and you don't know unless you look at your subscriptions, the owner has billion dollars but you talk with someone overseas to save money in the USA and can't understand them. It was a great company but they have competition and aren't the best so you need to check other sites for better pricing. It is also said it will go bankrupt within 5 years. Watch your statements monthly 4 unwanted charges."
3,Why do I have to log into the mobile site? This started after the last update. Both this and prime video require logging in to rent movies and now I have to log into the mobile site to print return labels. Perhaps its time to get rid of the app? The deals notifications for stuff not even close to what I set alerts for is kind of annoying.
4,"Some improvement is needed with the filters. Also, at random it requires re-verification of stored card info but it won't connect to Google Pay to pull my stored secure card which is annoying. It would be helpful if you could have different profiles for Prime so members of the same household can order things like birthdays gifts without it showing the other person."
2,"Why can't I disable the advertising notifications and pop ups? Going to the ""account preferences...app preferences... advertising preferences"" page in the app for both the regular app and the tablet version always gives error ""there's a problem connecting to Amazon right now"". It's been like this for months now, please fix or stop spamming my device with pop-ups"
3,"Works ok, better than the website on mobile, but I sometimes have trouble with wishlists refusing to load properly, and in recent months when the app tries to load the map for a delivery nearby it just fails and removes the map. As tracking my deliveries is a major reason for using the app, this is extremely annoying. It doesn't always notify me when something's out for delivery either. Reinstalling hasn't helped."
1,"Beyond terrible new feature. DO NOT UPDATE THE APP. DO NOT UPDATE. There is now a feature of a pop up add on like the ones where a bot is in a bubble in the lower corner. It is incredibly intrusive and distracting, causes a GREAT amount of lag & It is also in the way of scrolling."
1,The app is sooooo slow when it comes to loading a product and trying to add it to your list. I have to wait at least 10 seconds for the app page to semi download and it flashes and then I can click Add to List. There needs to be an easier way to add items to your wishlist without having to wait so long to add it to your list. App runs super slow.
1,"I am furious... Amazon shoving Alexa down my throat, having to put up with the""drop in"" on my screen both on phone and tablet. I don't like Alexa, I don't ever plan on using it. The stupid icon gets in my way and if you touch it, it wastes time by bringing up the screen to activate my microphone... Like I am ever going to do that! Maybe they ought to consider allowing users to opt out? Nah... That'd be too user friendly."
1,So there must be a new update. All of a sudden when I scroll the pictures every few start moving as though it's a tik tok video. It's annoying. I will not buy anything that I can't simply look at the picture of. It's annoying enough to the point I don't even want to look for anything on Amazon anymore.
2,"I've always liked Amazon since I've started using their site, many years ago. First you raise prime, ok, I understood THEN you stop the 2 day shipping, without notice that I saw. The 2 day shipping was the main reason I signed up for prime in the beginning, years ago. Seems like your not upholding your agreement, that you made. I've never had any complaints in all the years I've used. I'm sure you can do better, than breaking the contract you agreed to."
2,"even when i inputs the vehicles in my amazon garage, Amazon finds and even suggests parts that do not even match my vehicles. what's the point. one has to do alot of work to find the right parts. and even then, some get returned do to not a match. Lastly, reviews are such fakes. Can't even filter the fluff and only see confirmed purchases."
1,This app is so laggy it's infuriating. Half the time I try to look for stuff I just give up... The times I do order stuff I can never see my order progress... Just a blank screen or error message. Just adding items to the cart takes multiple tries THEN the other attempts show up in the cart too.
1,Alexa ruins the app makes it slow crash and very unstable. Since the last update the app is barely usable. Alexa even when turned off still shows up on the screen and throws up popups on how much better it would be if turned on . This hinders use of the app .
1,"Update... updated to latest version and while the performance is slightly better, the App response is lethargic at best. Selection of key buttons like orders is often met with 10 second delays before the app advances to the orders section. Amazon needs to address this as it's impossible to shop."
1,Fast and good layout. But literally doesn't work. You can add things to your cart but as soon as you go to buy your cart is empty and nothing happens. You would think that the app would be just like the website but it's not. Don't bother with this. There's no benefit to using the app and the website is way better anyway. Very disappointing.
1,Unfortunately after years of being a prime member I had to delete my account today. I got tired of amazon shipping everything item I order in padded envelopes. If I leave a bad review for a damaged item they just remove it. If I order a replacement item it's the same thing over and over again. Amazon support is just awful as well. Goodbye Amazon
5,"The app is excellent, it is great for when you want to do a quick browse and purchase on the fly without having to sign into the Web browser on your laptop. I've not encountered any bug or glitch on the app yet so I'm currently happy with using the app to make my purchase online using my mobile."
1,"There's 1milion promotions and useless items being shoved in your face, but the settings on this app are completely useless. User interface is such an embarrassment we use it as a bad example in our classes. It's 2022 and I need to contact customer support for every basic need."
2,"Ordering groceries on here is the worst. Don't think you're getting them in 2 hours, it's incredibly misleading. Instead they offer a two hour window, maybe for the same day, but I couldn't get them within 12 hours. What a waste of time on the shopping part though. Never again will I try and rely on them for groceries. On to DoorDash I guess."
2,"App should use device's language. Amazon Prime should make it clear that Amazon Photos are not included outside the USA. Amazon Prime should make it clear that Amazon Videos is a scam that will still ask for more money for every other film or later series' seasons even though you already pay monthly. Free shipping is worthless if you can find domestic platforms that are cheaper WITH shipping. Usability is good. Interface is pleasant. Need dark mode, though"
2,"Amazon needs to fight Chase on credit conditions. I have no bad credit, no missed payments, and I've spent enough with Amazon to BUY a Chase employee for a year. But because I've not personally had a Chase account, not invested with Chase, or been affiliated with a subsidiary, I was denied the Prime card, despite the credit check that should have came back good and now I'm reconsidering my shopping options being denied that 5% back benefit. Customers like me deserve better"
4,"App is good. Most products are what they are, great and as advertised. Love the next day delivery. But couple of times now, bought a couple of items in the lightibg/DJ department that didn't even work. One I waited for almost over a month and when it arrived, it doesn't even work."
2,"Their are not willing to take responsibility for third party sellers, I didn't choose third party sellers, Amazon did. So it bugs me that whenever an issue happens their support staff would say it's third party! Also there's no way to f filter for delivery dates, and it's very annoying when shopping, I don't want to see a zillion results that will ship from China in 4 months!"
4,I would have given five stars but I locked myself out of my account last August and they made me make another one so I did that the first one was set up on auto pay for my Amazon prime and they continue to charge me for my old accounts for 6-8 months and yeah they had to refund me like $250 it was just how does this s*** happen couldn't I see I wasn't buying anything off of it and that I had another one too and they're taking the money out of that one too was just ridiculous. Anyways that's that
1,Since the last update I can't buy any more books for my kindle on my phone or tablet. Prior to updating my tablet i could get books using that. Now even though I have the amazon uk shopping app i can't buy my kindle books from it. I have tried to call the customer service but they can't seem to find out why its not working. Very annoying and frustrating. I'm now buying direct from the authors site.
1,I have 3 items in my basket the add up to £23 and all have free delivery if total order is over £20 but before is defaults to the standard delivery when I go to checkout it's asks for more which more than the £24 I have on my balance so it won't let me proceed with the transaction. It's been like this forever and this NEEDS too be fixed!
5,Amazon shopping is absolutely fantastic in so many ways. The selection and variety of items is crazy good. I also like the return policies. It's difficult at times to order something that you can actually look at in person and be certain that's what you need. Thank you Amazon!
5,"I love to shop on the Amazon App. I'd shop more but I can't get approved just because I have no credit history which seems kinda stupid, no history is better than bad credit I would think. I've always paid with my bank card or cash so I've never had the need or want for any credit cards. If you can't pay it now you shouldn't get it. I just need approval from Amazon. C'mon now. I shop alot.."
5,"I absolutely LOVE the Amazon app (Amazon in general)!!! I have ordered things off Amazon numerous times, and will continue to do so for whatever I need (and even the things I probably don't 🤣)!! The shipping is great, and I've only had an issue once (which was handled in a timely manner, including the refund)."
3,"App has been behaving quite weird since lately. It usually works fine, I mean, its the Amazon app. But I'd go on it and see nothing but all the tabs. I close the app, open it and its the same. Id go in settings on my phone and ""force stop"" the app and uts the same. The web version seems to be OK."
5,"Very convenient and easy. some things are over priced which isn't Amazon's fault at all. only thing I would critique Amazon on is occasionally an item will get delivered to the wrong place but the saving grace is they don't say ""you're wrong"" when you say so. So overall I'm very happy with it especially as a recluse"
1,I have had Amazon prime Smile for a decade or more. I use prime for almost everything. Lately Amazon changed things so a notification is sent for everything thing. Literally every damn day another notification about a deal alert. I went into settings to turn off the notification option and guess what? If I turn off the option it also turns off Smile (donations to charity). Is Amazon so broke it can't make a donation unless it tries to sell me more? I will be saving money and shopping elsewhere!
4,"Great variety of just about everything, but, watch the prices. Prime is really the way to go tho. I enjoy window shopping and comparing sites, so I spend alot of time doing price research. It really can be an enjoyable experience."
3,"I love shopping Amazon shopping but it keeps freezing up and I'm losing patience with it. Thinking about shopping Overstock or Walmart or maybe somewhere else. Also you offered Prime with a senior discount which I like, and started charging a monthly price. I prefer to pay a yearly payment and have no monthly payment."
2,"Two stars for two reasons. First of all, I don't have a credit/debit card and therefore cannot spend 50 dollars, and therefore cannot leave reviews on things really need to be addressed, such as my $60 never-used headphones showing signs of wear and tear after not even a week, and now barely able to play sound (Bluetooth or not) without shutting down/randomly disconnecting from my phone. Second of all, I'm being rather generous right now and I don't want to regret it."
1,"Not possible to save photo's (not even the main item photo). I downloaded the app instead of using my browser in order to skip the endless time it takes for item photos to load in the browser, only to find that I can see the pix but not save them. UNINSTALLING"
5,"While using your app, I have a suggestion, that may be useful to other shoppers! It would be great if there was a way to organise my cart into projects. I do alot of projects and it would be good for me for costing/organization, to be able to sort my cart into items based on projects/rooms."
2,Hate it how it say if order more than X amount shipping would be free. When you check out it does not auto select the free shipping but pre-selected the 2 day option. You have to select the free option yourself. Also there's way to many bad quality on Amazon due to many people selling their products which is ordered from China website a low quality and cost but charge 5x the amount on Amazon. Products on Amazon use to be verified and reliable but now it's all chance.
5,"For most things I need when I can't get out, I love shopping Amazon. for the most part it has comparable prices. Sometimes though, Amazon promises one day or two day service, but because I live a few miles from the truck cut off I don't get the products until later. it is only a couple days, but sometimes those couple days mean a lot. Overall Amazon is great and I order everything from groceries to hobbies, from things for my grandchildren to household, such as dishes. Definitely 5 stars!"
3,"Sightly annoying. The notification never comes on until I unlock my phone, also, when I type something in the search bar it stays there even after I come back to the app it's still says what I last searched for so I have to delete it and type a new search, it should erase my search when I leave the app...still love Amazon. Update: after fixing the issue that erases the last search you typed, Amazon took it back to the old style, still can't erase old search 😑"
1,"I've used Amazon for years, have had prime, and the app and never had any issues until this new update. Now every time I try to load an item it tells me something went wrong and to reload the page shopping is almost impossible on this app now. I have gone from ordering stuff every couple days to now wanting to at all unless a necessity"
4,"I actually like this app now (app itself is pretty nice). The only thing I dislike is now certain tech products go out of stock never to be seen again, but that's not an Amazon-only problem, and most of the stuff I want stays in stock now. I feel they could still improve their inventory/stock of items, though (Sometimes you literally have to buy them right now or you will never get them again, like if it were eBay)."
2,"Done with Prime! Items arrive late more often than not. You pay all this money for prime and they dont hold up their end of the bargain. Now they are raising prime to $139 + tax? $150 a year? No thanks! I'll pay less to have something shipped and get it in the same amount of time as if I had paid all that money. My $150 might not matter to Amazon, but I'm not the only one. There are too many more reliable companies out there now that can deliver faster. Amazon is no longer the only one."
1,"For some reason, two shortcuts have been added to my order menu. Morrisons and Fanshop. Most annoyingly, these are two shortcuts I don't want, need, and will probably never use. How do I get rid of them because I can't find where but I also can't stop them auto-opening when accessing the menu"
1,"Must print return label or pay $1 to have label mailed to me for some items but you don't know which item until after you buy an item! This contradicts Amazon's policies and should not be allowed. Breach of contact when it says free! Seems lots of other prime members are complaining about app update causing issues, vendors being allowed to cancel orders when delivery dates can't be met and cost increase. Get with it or I'll start supporting local stores."
1,Edit: Now 7/12/22 and still unusable. The app is basically unusable on my LG V40 since a recent update. Pages take too long to load and sometimes they only partially finish. I've never had an issue before until recently. Edit: Wanted to add that it's now 5/19/2022 and the app still does not function properly on my device. I don't understand how the app could get this bad when it used to be one of the better Android apps available.
5,I order from Amazon mainly because of the time it takes to receive my order. its almost like physically shopping in a store when you're getting most of your items the next day (in some instances the same da). if I'm not getting my purchase the next day at least let me know when to expect your item(s). Amazon does that.
1,"App is extremely broken and prime does NOT work at all. I honestly feel scammed. I have prime, but for some reason the app does not acknowledge that so its forcing me to pay a higher price and pay for shipping, despite me having prime. It even doesn't show that in the subscription settings... After the new updates they've fully broken it. I will be deleting the app as it's a huge scam if you have prime. Website version works fine, only the app sucks."
2,"Terrible app. Why do they make it nearly impossible to get help with a return (or any problem for that matter)? You have to go through an entire scavenger hunt in order to get someone to contact you, and then if you don't respond to their chat within like 45 seconds, it just clears it and you have to start over."
2,"The app constantly freezes or will not load the orders page, has been this way for months. It makes it significantly more challenging to go through the return process at every point in the process - setting up the return, pulling up the return barcode to scan at ups, check for refund, etc."
3,I don't understand why all of the sudden I can't purchase certain things to be delivered to my address. it's happening with all different sorts of items and it never happened before. literally eyeglasses with 1.0 magnification are fine and then I switch the magnification and I get red type saying that it can't be delivered to my address so if somebody could explain this to me I would I'd like to know what's going on.. thank you
5,It is so convenient when I can't find something in the stores to just order it. Returns are super easy if they are ever necessary (I've only had to return two things in five years of shopping). There are so many benefits to being a Prime member. I wish I would've joined years ago.
3,"I loved this app until the most recent update. When I try to look at my orders, the page just continually glitches. Update: I've updated it several times since I posted this review and I'm still having the same issue. Update: 7/1/22 I still can't see my orders on this app. It's very frustrating."
1,I am pretty upset that you can no longer purchase kindle books in the app. I am an avid reader; now I have to open up a web browser to then log in through the website to find my book of interest again and then purchase it. I have always loved this app for the provided product diversity and customer service. However in this matter the app has taken a large step back in customer usability and satisfaction for a significant demographic of shoppers.
2,"Probably 1 of the worst applications I use on a regular basis. Everything is so slow. Why? Because it's all web based. Even the UI can't be like ""here I am"" and populate LATER because IT is web based too. Please PLEASE improve on system load times, increase your download file size, and make an application we can use. Increase the amount of storage you take on my phone. If anybody is struggling with storage space. This is the 21st century. Buy an sd card."
1,"""The delivery location you selected is beyond the sellers shipping location"" when selecting an Amazon Hub location for pickup. Why is this happening? I'm a truck driver and I'm not home often. You're losing money because you can't ship a tiny product that fits in one hand to an Amazon hub? **** FIX MULTIPLE ORDER TRACKING *** Differentiate which items where picked up and which ones STILL NEED TO BE PICKED UP. Very confusing. ALSO, CANNOT LEAVE REVIEWS. FIX YOUR SERVICE!"
1,Why on earth have you changed the browsing screen? It's beyond tedious to scroll through one item at a time. I have gone through every option in the menu and there's no longer anyway to switch like their used to be. As others have mentioned navigating around this app is an utter chore
2,"Searching items can be very frustrating. Results are not always correct. Example mens items show when searching women's; not able to filter juniors, misses, plus sizes, ect effectively; sponsored items show in search results that are not even related to the item that is being searched for, ect"
1,"Amazon is least customer responsive company. Their emails do not list the items you order and same with items you return. Last 2 times, I could not return the items through app, had to go to their website. And there is no way to report issues with their app or website. They don't care about your feedback."
4,7.26.22 update. The app update didn't work. It works much better now that I've completely uninstalled/re installed it. Update: Still messed up. Update: looks like the reason is they're getting ready for a large update. Usually pretty great. For SOME reason purchases and orders are having trouble loading... ... still....
1,"Don't download this app. Amazon is nice shopping app. But it has a issue. ""something went wrong on our end "" error appear all the time. Then I installed it to my secondary phone. It's worked, fine for few days. Again it's stop responding. I think Amazon IT team don't give fxxx for this CS5 error issue. 1000 of people stragglers. But no solution.. thank you once again for IT team☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️"
1,"Terrible app. Why ? Simple. In messages not able to answer. If you click on view in amazon ? Strange, I look already in te amazon app to the message? Then I still can not answer it. Links to rules are lost. Like if you click on a link from a seller his conditions. Strang that amazon can not build a good app!"
5,"I love Amazon! So easy, convinent and most times cheap.. There are so many varieties, you can always find what your looking.. I have been using it for years and will continue to do so. Prime makes the experience much better."
3,"I like Amazon for many things but I'm starting to get upset, my shipping dates changing constantly is bound to make me upset but I get it. The issue comes when I get no notification for these changes, you can't just change my shipping date and not notify me. Its actually starting to make me angry that amazon can't handle sending a notice for a simple thing like delivery date changes. Please update the UI to send a notification when there are changes to the estimated delivery date."
1,I have the latest fire stick and it malfunction during an automatic update. They did nothing to fix it or stand by their product. I think it might be a scam for seniors with disabilities like us. So I'll seek alternative devices and shopping sites.
1,"Every single add to cart is now an option to upsell you more junk. Who on earth wants a protection plan for their toilet paper. because you purchased an ink pen, would you like to also buy a skid of printer paper. I'm 100% sure that a check box on the item you're buying would have been much easier than a pop-up, making this a blatant cash grab."
4,I like this app. It does do my Amazon Smile purchases through the app so I don't have to put something in my cart and go to Amazon later through my desktop. I like the notifications on deliveries. I don't use my phone extensively for shopping or making purchases but I do wish they would include fingerprint identification to access your account as an additional security measure. I'm sure that the people that developed this can figure out how to do it.
1,"So frustrating, no matter what I try, the screen with the dog pops up and won't let me shop. Useless app. I've checked and I'm using the updated version. I had deleted it due to the ""oops something went wrong"" message and it looks like I'll be deleting it again."
1,"Recent 2019 updates problem never get fix. Uninstalled and reinstalled severals time. Cleared caced and data but doesnt seem to solved the problem. Unable to get to Amazon homepage. It directed me to "" Something went wrong on our end"" uninstalled the app and access thru web instead. Shame on you, developer!"
2,"So you select next day delivery as you need it next day, they are now cancelling that and swapping it to an ""amazon delivery date"". Which is so sneeky, you have to go back and wdit the order, so that thing i needed for work,didnt come in time. Also the quality is starting to falter, im seeing lots of either overpriced or low quality products starting to flood the page. Ive found better deals, better quality and on the day i needed it by going to shops myself. Im disapointed."
1,"Keep away! Horrible customer service. I tried to purchase a macbook pro and after I tried to pay it. It automatically locked my account with no explanation or whatsoever. So I provided my bank details and my billing details. Then I heard nothing. So I was thinking maybe it was the card's fault so I tried it again, let me get in to use my other card and it did the same thing all of a sudden it is locked again. Charged me $6.99 couldn't even use Amazon prime because ""account is locked"""
1,Worst ever search function in the history of the Universe. Can't ever find anything you are looking for because you have to be insanely specific with your search criteria and even then it will show you loads of stuff completely non related. In short this makes the app absolutely useless as it's so infuriating to use.
3,"Since Samsung updated to Android 12 my alerts have changed. All my settings are the same, but the app makes no sound. I would get a sound alerts when item is shipped, on way, stops away, but nothing now apart from a little icon top of screen. What's happened to the app?"
1,"I ordered two things and they were damaged in transit and when I called for a replacement they said they could only replace one, They're so unprofessional and not worth the 12.99 a month that I pay for Prime!! What's the point of paying for prime if they can't even deliver the product safely. Customer service is a joke!!!"
1,"Can't buy eproducts like ebooks, mp3s, or videos from the app. This is probably cause Google wants a cut of epurchases, but their is no way to cut over to a web browser that doesn't have this limitation. I can no longer wishlist mp3 albums, so I cant even save this search for later on home browser. I really need a non Google store APK file without this epurchase limitation."
1,"NEW BUG. None if my purchases are showing last two updates. Also when you can't remember your password it offers me a phone number to varify by text message thats years old! So I try by email and get a code,I put that code in the App that redirects to a web portal that is frozen! so I can't pick ANY of the options! now i'm locked out of my App and Laptop! AND desperate to return broken items on arrival! horrible wasted 2days : Fingerprint would have helped!"
4,"It's a good app. I use it all the time. But recently it's not letting me view my orders... The page just flashes as it is loading, and never loads. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. They need to send out a bug fix"
5,"I always enjoy my Amazon experience, esp having a review list that is straightforward and unedited by actual verified purchaser's. I have purchased several excellent products for a now 100lb+ maligator w no clue what about enormous she is and everything has held up for over a year now w/out so much as a hiccup. Given her tendency to test every purchase w razor sharp teeth, this is saying a great deal indeed...thx amazon!"
3,The app was eorking well. Last night checked on the purchases I had made. They were being shipped or proccessed. Nothing wrong. Have or had 2 items to be delivered by 10 this evening. Went to check on the status this morning. I had to sign in again just like I was a new user. And lost all my items. I had purchased. Says I had not purchased anything for 4 montherd. This is wrong. I had purchased items this past Thursday or Friday. Called support and they could not find the items purchased. ?????
1,I hate that when I subscribe and save it says that it's going to arrive in a week come to find out it gets changed to month later. I've had this happen on multiple items. Just because you subscribe and save doesn't mean that you should have to wait over 30 days for a delivery.
4,"Everything is fine until you try and scroll through the similar product carousel on a single item page. I scroll over a little bit, then it glitches me back to the top of the page. When scrolling back down to the carousel, it's now empty. Now I have to go back a couple pages and start my search over. Frustrating."
4,"I use this app frequently; it works fine except for the ""track order"" feature. That only works about 2/3 of the time. For example, they'll be at my door knocking yet the tracker shows they're in Lakewood & have been sitting in one spot for an hour."
1,All the Amazon apps like kindle have gotten worse with each update. Now you can't buy any kindle books or update any subscriptions through the app. You have to go through a browser to access subscriptions or buy books. Amazon needs to make it how it used to be to keep it convenient and keep customers happy. Not make it harder.
3,"the most frequently used places like orders, shopping cart, and history are harder to find than they should be. also annoying is Amazon tries to skip the checkout screens on the mobile app and can screw up my order if I want it to a different address or using different payment information."
2,"Amazon is a great place to order pretty much anything, but how long it takes to recieve what you've ordered has now become a problem. I have been a prime member longer than I can remember and the shipping time has just became awful...there is ALWAYS a delay and I never get my orders when I am supposed to. At this point it's like regular shipping would be 5 to 7 an sometimes more business days! I also don't like you can't choose who'd you would like to ship with via usps, ups, FedEx etc....."
1,"Can't login to the account we've had for over ten years casue the number in file is wrong and can't verify text message. Called in, they have a series of questions to verify that are ridiculous. They should just send a verification code or link to verify ownership of the account, however they make it incredibly difficult."
3,I've never got to use this app at all but somebody's been using it in my name under my other account and I think it's messed up but Amazon when you call customer service won't help you get back into your other account and they continue to allow another individual that has access to my email account and the old phone number that's associated with it it is a shame that they allow people to continue to use my account when I have not given authorization for any of that thievery or fraud
1,"The app on my Google Pixel 6 Pro is not working at all. I've reinstalled it multiple times and cleared cache and stored data. I click on something, it says ""Uh-Oh! Something went wrong!"" It's unusable. I have use my laptop to order anything as of right now."
3,"I LOVE shopping with Amazon BUT I hate how every time I click a product link it just takes me to the home screen, not the actual product! (This is on all links not just one or two) it was fixed for a while, but now it's doing it again. I have to clear the cache and reload the link. Please do whatever yall fixed before again lol - however my fiance and the mail man are happy with the brief reprieve in a million packages being delivered every day!"
1,"Your app isn't loading anything accept the account tab and the menu tab. My cart, home tab, lists, orders, etc will NOT load. The app is a ghetto mess the more it's updated. And since I cannot communicate with the useless customer service I'm done wasting time with no results. Walmart uses the same merchants for the same products. Piece of junk."
1,I've been an Amazon customer since they were known for selling books. My last experience with them was horrendous and insulting. I ordered a book a week and a half before I needed it for a training program and got a package on Friday. There was nothing inside. I contacted customer support and explained that I needed the materials by that Wednesday and that it was important. A few days later I got 2/3 books. They gave me two months free membership. Can't cancel because I'd lose access to media.
2,This App was great until the update a little while sgo. It takes forever to load and crush often. Its not as intuitive as the early version and I havent used it at all lately. I use my laptop or my Fire. But I don't have them with my at all times like my phone. So I feel I'm not shopping as much. Fix this or go back to the earlier version!
5,"Amazon is the best. I have easy shopping, ordering, delivery very quickly. If I have a return, Amazon provides the shipping label and credit is provided quickly thereafter. I wish that all stores were set up like Amazon. They know their stuff!"
3,"The app is the only way to chat to customer service. It takes a while for them to reply (not complaining about that, I know they need time to sort things on their end), but by the time I've gone back to the chat, they've gone & I can't see what they've said. Being able to look back on chats is an essential update they need. Either save the chat or send a transcript of it by email. Having it disspear before even being able to see what they've said is just ridiculous."
2,"Actually i liked Amazon a lot, untill i had this problem. Half of my delivery was purchased and the other half declined. In my settings i had direct debit as prefered payment. The credit card i dont have anymore. However, it is not enough to have a direct debit account, it is necessary to have a credit card if you want to shop with Amazon (said from customer service). Now i explored AliExpress and Etsy. Great apps, easy and customer friendly to use and to pay. 👌"
1,"The app is poorly made. It autocorrects when I don't want or need it to, also the search results NEVER show the items you searched for. I don't know who designed the search algorithm, but they sure didn't have the customer in mind."
1,"Amazon is just like ebay now, anyone can sell on there. You will encounter problems with 3rd party sellers. Of the last 12 items ordered x4 had to go back (damaged or completely wrong item sent) sometimes you have to pay postage on returns, even if item was damaged in transit... not as safe as you think unfortunately..."
1,"Item weren't in the final order in Amazon Fresh. My first order, I thought I forgot to include it but now it happened again and I was sure I added 2x6 1.5L of water bottles. Customer support said they can't find my order to have been added but it's the first item I add all the time. The reason I use Amazon fresh is to have those heavy water bottles delivered. I won't order through here again as items seems to ""disappear"" from final order."
1,This recent update has made it hard for me to see when a package is arriving. I preorder a lot of books and stuff so when somethings shipped it doesn't come to the top anymore and there's no option to filter it by arrival date like it used to automatically be.
3,"After migration from Souq to Amazon, detected several bugs, problems: images for some products are mixed with others, filtration of search results became worse, limitation of approx 20 hits per page in Searching. And the worst: some products' return policy is terrible (I have to return it by myself through Aramex/DHL!) There should be several large-scale enhancements!"
5,It is very easy to shop with Amazon. You are able to get just about every thing you want or need. I have been using Amazon for over 10 years or more. I will keep prime for ever. I also recommend kindle fire and kindle paperwhite. Better than other e readers.
1,"Horrible app. I travel a lot and Amazon keeps changing my settings like I change underwear 🥴 It's difficult to find currency and country settings and even if you finally find it, it doesn't save it properly. so I must uninstall and install all the time."
1,Returning products when they messed up is unrealistic. I have received the wrong items several times and it has cost me way more money than I would have saved. No support contacts. Horrible customer service! Would not recommend!
1,Lately you order something in Amazon and it takes 3 weeks to get it shipped out of their warehouses. What is this Wish 2.0? Where are the days where you ordered something and you get it in less than a week? Dont get me started on Prime. I cancelled that and then made a comparison with a friend. He having Prime showed items out of stock and I could order the same item. Which I did. Then found something different and we added the same amount and listof items. My order was cheaper without Prime.
1,"This app is really slow and crashes a lot. Also, the app won't let me get a prime membership through my phone and simply says "" You may not sign up for Amazon Prime in the mobile application"". This had never been the case and is costing me a lot of money per package. I also contacted customer service and they told me I can only get membership through a laptop or PC. I really hope this is temporary because this app has 500+ million downloads and it just denied a membership to millions of users."
1,"It has been months since the app started crashing repeatedly upon opening and not be fixed until whole data wipe, and the developers are unable to fix it! It has gotten much worse recently! I have to clear data every time I want to enter the app!"
1,The app is fine but I have had nothing but trouble with Amazon. My last order was delivered to the wrong address they did nothing to compensate for this. I have instructions on all my packages most times they are ignored. And packages don't arrive on promised date. I'm frustrated to the point i don't want to order from Amazon anymore.
1,"After downloading this app, my orders have been late / misquoted. I have had an account with Amazon for a very long time. This app though, seems to reflect what I read in the media about how Amazon treats its workers. Can't even get them on the phone and their drivers keep making excuses not to meet delivery quote times...great app, Amazon."
3,Pictures not loading on Dark Mode like they use to do. Work fine for the majority other than filtered results when applying prime and low to high removes results that would normally be listed if left as default making it much harder to find things than it should be.
1,You have to manually delete items from your wish list one at a time. Why can't we choose multiple items to remove at one time? It's a basic feature that every shopping app has except Amazon. Update: 2 years later this feature still hasn't been added.
5,"I joined Prime thinking I'd try it out as an occasional convenience. The convenience has become an essential part of making life easier and more efficient, both as a convenience and economically, respectively."
1,"If you block ANY ads, the app throws up an ""UH-OH Something went wrong on our end."" page, rendering it completely useless. This, despite the fact that everything else loads just fine until the error message appears. Still an issue as of July 29."
3,Have no complaints. All orders have come in on schedule. Easy to use. Any problems taken care of immediately. HAVE come to conclusion AMAZON is selling 2bds and 3rds. NOT FIRST QUALITY products to us. I purchase BOOST abs ENSURE food supplements. The product arrives in an Amazon box. The product is in their box with their label stamp on the box. Out side is good. Open the product box. The bottles are dented. I ASK how does this happen? My guess is seconds and thirds. How about you?
2,"Ever since the last update, I'm not getting notifications about items having been shipped or out for delivery. That's the main reason I keep the app, I don't even like the layout of the app. May as well uninstall and just keep an eye on shipments through the desktop site."
4,"Great as always!! Although, I noticed in June, a recent price increase occured in Feb 2022? Only a $ increase, but don't remember them ever informing me of new ""automatic monthly payment"" ?? However, since it occurred at the beginning of year, I may have missed it? As that's when I received all new TOS and /or privacy policies from many apps especially those regarding payments? It would be nice if they were a little more straightforward about increasing the rate??"
2,"Try before you but SCAM!! I've been using ""try before you buy"" for a while and it's been so helpful but a recent change means they now make your bank hold the money whilst you ""try"". Defeats the objective completely! I would never of ordered if this change was made clear! I usually order a few dresses, try them and keep one, but this change means it's no longer beneficial as all the money is on hold even though I never keep everything, it's really messed me over with a direct debit that's due😭"
1,"Since the last update every time I open the app my phone freezes, then eventually the app restarts itself. For a couple of months I have been regularly checking for a new update that fixes this issue. I am surprised this is still happening."
1,"Ever since the update on May 25, 2022, I have to uninstall and reinstall the Amazon Shopping APP to have access to it. If there were any improvements, it's not noticible. 07/20/22 Dropped rating to 2 stars. 07/28/22 1 star. No changes. I still have to uninstall and reinstall everytime I want to check my account."
1,"Wow. This new app that it forced me to update, that I just HAD to have in order to even use my app anynore... Is absolute TRASH. My orders are gone. Can't even see update on orders... The picture icon that looks like a user icon doesn't work... The three line setting looking icon doesn't work. Literally only home and cart work... And not well This app is now useless. I guess it's time I uninstalled from phone... Was trying to check on order since internet is out... But I guess that's not allo"
5,"Saved us Multiple Times!Amazon= My FAV app on all devices!Obsessed! 90%+ of Christmas shopping done here 4Last 3 years!They saved Christmas all through the pandemic!The $ = usually top Noche & 4Awesome items!95% of purchases, no matter the $are attached 2high quality items! They usually go above expectations-How long they last/How well they work! When they do not, refund processes= Fast/Easy! When $ a cheaper item, usually think will not last long, but lasts longer. Use HONEY w/Amazon = PERFECT!"
5,"What can you say about Amazon but the fact that it's outstanding and the service you get with the chat options is way cool. You can always find the best deals and easy returns with no hassle, they're making it so much easier to use. Its almost as well as eBay."
1,"WHY is Prime no longer a search filter option? Not only is the Prime toggle gone, but it's not an option in the filters list either. If I'm paying an annual fee, I should absolutely be able to filter by Prime products! Talk about two giant leaps backward! Stupidest thing ever!!"
4,honestly this company is great and if your patient and dig through all the pages you can find better deals on here then any where else there shipping is relatively good and if there's an issue with anything there really good at correcting it as long as you call them but that's the hard part though. that they need to work on making there customer service agents easier to contact because honesty it is a real pain in the a** and they need to teach them how to better relate and understand customers
2,Crashing and freezing is more frequent than ever before. I always make sure there is not an update I need too. I often lose patience with the freezing and close the app only to open another place to order from.
1,"Horrible app so many errors and slow, lots of problems and then on top of it, bad buying experience at this store, poor customer service, they do revolving chat agents and pass the buck and never solve problems. Will uninstall, not a good reliable app or store for me, lots of issues!"
5,"I love ordering from this site -- both one-time and auto ship orders are always correct, on time and intact. No substitutes are made unless I authorize them, and if ever something is out of stock, I am notified, then kept up to date with the new anticipated delivery date. So very easy and reliable!"
1,"Don't get prime! Prices are higher and services has declined. When purchasing items, the shipping is a problem. Says, it will get here tomorrow, but they change shipping info longer. Takes longer to receive item where as before, Amazon was on it. Disappointed."
2,Keeps crashing every time I open. They keep adding features that no one wants like Alexa integration. I just want to shop with ease and it already has voice search with Google. Stop adding useless features and focus on stability
2,"Yes there are times when you get very good orders but the majority when I order something and I cancel it sometimes I don't get my money back or even shows up as Amazon credit, sometimes I don't even get my order and just a recently it shows that I haven't had a order in the last 3 months when I ordered probably the most and my purchase of something not so cheap doesn't appear anywhere."
5,"I love Amazon, absolutely my go to site/service for almost everything I buy. I've bought thousands of dollars worth of electronics, housewares, clothes, crafts, etc. I have a regular Amazon Prime membership and the value of free shipping on most items is HUGE. Plus Amazon Prime streaming as an entertainment source. I constantly enjoy the convenience, quality, and value that Amazon brings right to my door or convenient nearby locker location for added security"
1,"Usually a great app and would of been happy to give it 5 stars but today went on my account today to check a previous order and all orders have gone, I also noticed my wish list was different, I realised that my account for some reason switched from UK to USA by itself, all OK now I switched it back to UK, this has worried me as who's wish list was I seeing when it was in USA setting, Please Amazon fix this problem, worried about security on my account"
5,"app works great, the new layout is easier to use with buttons across the bottom so that you can easily get to things you have ordered now. it was always a bit of a faff before. much easier to use than the previous version."
1,"Tried for weeks to upgrade, app fails. Tried upgrade thru Play store, system doesn't recognize app. Through Edge I couldn't update and you will get ads and I do not want ads. Guess I'm done shopping on Amazon. Only way to get Amazon App to update was to uninstall and then download new app. What a pain."
2,It's OK but i hate it when you search amazon app for products then few days later amazon sends email saying based on your search we thought you like to have a look at these. Sending too many emails via this app. Just wished amazon wouldn't do cookies to track your activity. Also stopped showing all my purchases so app needs work to improve it!
2,"They put up a delivery date, but then continue to push it back. It the item is out of stock, and not available at that time. They need to put that up. Pushing delivery dates back is just going to aggravate customers. Especially when the membership for Amazon is so much."
3,"The app can be confusing. I got geroceries one time and instead of using the EBT card they tried pulling from my cash card. Of course at that time there wasnt enough to make that purchase. I wouldnt have known they didnt use the EBT card if that purchase had gone through.Why wouldnt they use the one for food in the first place. That would have messed up my tight budget alot had the cash been pulled. I love Amazon but, that experience really put my guard up so it makes it stressful to use."
1,"I have had the same issue with Amazon over 6 different times. Between a flaw in their system, and the customer service department being dumb as hell, I can't get packages delivered to my house. I have no option over who delivers my packages. The lady across the street will not let me have my packages unless I give her money. Amazon refuses to send it through Fed Ex, UPS, or even Amazon Prime vehicles, even though I pay for Prime. What's the point in buying anything I cannot receive. Never again."
2,2.5 Stars. App works ok. Would be nice if we could use our fingerprint to log in or confirm order before the transaction is made. Should be an additional security requirement before your credit card is used. Also needs a dark theme. Home menu too busy. Doesn't allow you to customize the menu.
1,"As it stands I can't look at my orders through the app. It loads forever and alternating between Wi-Fi and data provider doesn't fix the issue, whereas every other app responds perfectly. Fix this, it's getting aggravating."
3,New interface is hard to use. Customer service is never available. There used to be an easy rating system on how my packages were delivered and now there isn't. Also I used be able to ask for my package to be left within a foot of my front door and not left on the sidewalk.
1,"Continuously crashes and very slow lately. I have to resort to logging into my amazon account via my laptop if I want to do anything or check orders. Its especially bad when attempting to check on orders, never loads or shows an error message. Poor app quality."
5,"I love Amazon shopping from free grocery delivery or virtually every thing that they have in stock. They're delivery of items is impeccable, right down to the great employees that deliver items. knock on wood I have not had to return anything I have bought from Amazon yet, which o might add I have bought a great deal of items over the past few years. I recommend Amazon to all I know, I could be a commercial for them as a brand and for the convenience and the quality and prices of their products"
3,"Could use some updates to the list. Should be able to select multiple items to move to a new list or to delete. Also need to add more filtering options when looking for items. Additionally, way too many reviews are not for the item being sold so you can't go by reviews"
5,"I'm excited to be an ""Amazon Prime Queen"". I tell everyone, I can shop whenever I want, wherever I want, @ my convenient time. Amazon gives me the opportunity to shop with different sellers which gives me the advantage of comparing prices v/s quality and qwantity. I can shop worldwide with free shipping majority of the time. Amazon gives me information on the seller of my products along with communication options with the seller. Also, verified customer reviews and questions are a bonus."
2,"This app gets worse. Now every time I open it a message appears telling me I cannot sign up for Prime in the app. Thanks for the letting me know that. Tapping continue dows nothing, you have to close and reopen. Weak effort."
4,great app easy to use the only problem I had was with the delivery options I missed it. It's in small blue writing that I missed so the item that was same delivery become next day delivery. So please display the delivery options more clear at checkout like the website.
5,"Amazon makes it easy to shop from home and I like that most items arrive within 2 days with Prime. There's a good selection to choose from and most of the time I can tell from product descriptions, photos and the reviews if it is an item I am looking for. It takes time but without the running around with no guarantee of finding what you want. Works well for me."
1,"Don't bother with the app if you run ad/tracker blocking on your network. Every attempt to use app will result in a oops dog image, but Amazon works fine in browser. Just another example of a company going above and beyond to monetize your data and throwing a fit when you tell them no."
3,"This would have five stars except for one major flaw. To exit the app it should be more simpler than having to either back the way out of every screen you visited or forcing it closed. They should have set it up so all you have to do is hit the home button in app and then the back button on your phone to exit the app, like it used to be several years ago. The saddest part about leaving a review is the developer will ignore this review and won't fix a darn thing."
4,Pretty good for anything you want or need. I have only had something bad happen 1 time. You just got to check the buyers of where you're getting it from making sure it's compatible with the product or whatever it is that you're buying that you want and not a retailer make sure it's the main place
3,"I like shopping on this app. But the subscribe and save is kind of ridiculous. If I subscribe when it's 20 dollars, that should be a contracted price so they can't increase it. What's the point on saving 5 percent on the seen price, if they are just going to increase the price to keep getting the regular price? Makes no sense."
1,"That app must take The worst app to search for a product ever. If you are trying to search for a mobile model, you will never found it easily but you will get unrelated phone model that there is no word in your search mentioned that phone! Also the filters is in another plant! You can't find app worse that it! Shame on Amazon!"
2,"The newest updates have made it so difficult to just select ""shop by department"". Instead you have to navigate 37 recommended menus or get sent to things you don't want because they were trending instead of getting the thing you searched for"
1,"Since they don't wanna let me post my review under what I purchased. Anyway watch who you purchase stuff from on this stupid app because it took a month for me to even get my product which was one item,and then they turned around and said it would be another week. Only to deliver it to a whole different address in a whole different state."
1,"You definitely need to do something about your search. Not even close to the search words items pop ups, no way to search by certain important characteristics of the items, in the search from low to high prices you need to go through the millions of not related cheap $0.01 price items, but no way to set actual price range other then from zero."
4,"I love this app. I gave it 4 stars because of 2 things. I need dark mode and it does not have it. Also this is not Amazon's fault but I can not purchase my books, movies, and music like I use too. I will also be making this same comment on other apps. I know Google changed some terms of use so they had to discontinue it but I hate hate hate going online."
1,Prime button not working. I have tried on the app and I have tried on my browser and you cannot turn the prime button on. That also means that filtering and sorting is messed up. This happened overnight. Please fix what y'all did.
1,"I have to go through the Amazon shopping app in order to rent a movie. Unfortunately I don't have the option of renting or even buying any movie on the app, unless I want to buy a dvd. I'm very disappointed to no longer have the option to buy or rent, I can only stream what is being offered. Very disappointed."
5,"I love ❤ this App it safe , it keeps and stores all your favorite items, you can add or delete items, ordering is easy, The only thing I would change is the timing when placing an order, it takes longer to process your payment, and ship out your items Other than that nice app😀"
1,"No longer provides the ability to purchase ebooks. For reasons known only to Amazon, it is no longer possible to purchase ebooks using this app for downloading to the Kindle readers. That was my primary use for this app. In it's place, Amazon expects you to go to a their website, log in, and then search, find and purchase what you want. Just like in the 1990's."
1,"I bought a new 99 dollar earbuds three days ago. Just one day after I receive the earbuds the price cut 20 dollar off. I was so pissed-off beauce Amazon could send me a notification or something else tell me that they were going to have a big cut on this item. Plus I can't return this item because of some stupid policies, and it still charge me one more month after I canceled my prime. Rate -100 stars if possible."
3,This app is great if you order something and it turns up. Then it fails miserably if your parcel don't arrive or you only have had a certain amount delivered. Out of the multiple choice questions there wasn't one for me! And seriously don't ring up customer service. They are embarrassing at best and will not help you
1,"Never used it, never want to. Of you want an upgrade to 3 stars, it's easy: make it eligible for external storage so I can free up a little of my precious internal memory. Your app is. not. mission-critical. Don't kid yourselves."
1,Right now this is my only option for many things I need. Amazon however is a pain in the butt. Packages are frequently delayed and if they get delayed to tracking just breaks. and to be honest that's not a deal breaker late packages don't really matter. However If I try to get customer service to help more often then not they just lie to me about it and if they were just transparent I'd be so much happier as a customer. Can't wait to drop this company.
1,"Simple and easy to use and informations are correct and updated. I use the app to search and I use the PC version to order. Both are doing what they say they do. This far I didn't face any mishaps. Keep it up👍 Edit: all my lists, order history deleted after newest update. Why? And all the prices on $ not €why?"
2,I lost much money by ordering in Amazon.I returned the products four or five times in the last six months. Every time they gave in the app that the money is refunded. But when i check my bank account there is no credit. Customer service is not responding. There is no mail id for customer care. So i lost the amount and the Amazon is the gainer. Every time i lose money. After this complaint i got credit for one item But one more refund is pending Order date Order date 18-Apr-2022 Order # 18-Ap
1,I signed up for a free trial prime membership when I tried to cancel it all of a sudden they set up two factor authentication not me! And I lost my old number and so they would not let me cancel my prime and its because you have to login to your account but I can't so now they are purposely trying to obstruct me from canceling prime before the end trial date! I have no card on file cus it's canceled and informed them there's no longer a valid payment method so don't get at me later cus I tried
2,"Do not like this update.!!! Very frustrating which no one needs right now.. Just to find out when my order will be delivered or if it has shipped you have to go thru a maze. Before update, everything was smooth.. Bring the smooth back please. Also don't like the shopping changes the setup is all wrong. That's all I got."
4,"Compare with similar items, HA! More like compare with what's already in your cart and nothing more OR it suggest items complete off target to what you are shopping for. I recall the feature actually comparing your selected item to ""similar"" related items, be it other brands of same type of products or same item brand but different price and seller. Not anymore! All you get is a preview of other items already in your cart or junk. Since post pandemic things have changed. #Yawn"
3,"I would have given the app higher trying to have an issue. When you are trying to tell Amazon our order had one broken, no option similar so I hit the back button, I tried to talk to live person from chat option, then message popped up that there was no problem, Good buy! Noo.. 1 was broken!"
4,"Problem with notifications recently. it's not notifying me at all until I open the app, then it appears (which is not the point at all 🤣). I've checked my notification settings, hasn't been tampered with. Otherwise it's great, been using for about 3 years now."
2,Something is wrong with the app. Keeps telling me Something is wrong and going to home when I do a search - for anything. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still getting the issue. Cannot use the app on my Android phone while this is happening.
2,"The app is fine, customer service is the problem, I didn't receive an order, and left a review starting that, and Amazon refused to post the review. It's against their community standards. I called customer service, but they didn't understand the problem, and kept telling me that I couldn't return the item, because it had been too long since I ordered it, the item that I never received. Do yourself a favor, and shop somewhere else."
4,love shopping on Amazon i don't always have time to go to the store and having my essentials auto delivered makes life easier... I loved the app till they updated and you can't buy the digital books or digital movies / tv shows directly on app now and unfortunately they did the same update on all other Amazon apps
5,"Navigation on sute is a breeze. The selection keeps on growing. If your looking for something in perticular in one of the stores you grew up with. Just take your phone out, yes right where you were, and open Amazon's website. Type in what your in search of, in less then 5 seconds a rush of wide selection of what you e been seaching for. Make your selection and in a couple of days its delivered to your home. My kind of shopping."
1,"I have been a prime member for numerous years. This year is the first year I will not be a returning customer, with incorrect products sent, wrong addressed deliveries, and horrible customer support I am officially done with Amazon prime and will not support a business that doesn't care about the individuals purchasing from them. Everyone uses Amazon now and it really shows in all areas, because the quality is sub par now."
2,"I bought a pair of sneakers from Amazon and followed the tracking and right before they went out for final delivery I got a notice saying they were damaged and won't be delivered. In the meantime, I had to call my bank and get a new card issued because my cards magnetic strip or chip, whatever, stopped working. Amazon never contacted me to refund my money. Amazon still have $50 of mine. Crooks."
1,Too slow. Suggestions are never anything close to what you typed in. You can actually type exact description of a product then scroll through suggested garbage before you actually get to the product you tried to search. Not to mention it always cuts off my prime option.
3,"Used to be much better! I make many purchases based on shipping times. Over the last year, they make several claims about shipping times and they are never on time! Why make a false claim! Give me honest shipping times and I'll give you my business. As much as deliveries have been 3 and 4 days later than stated, it's hard to believe there isn't some deception going on :("
5,What can I say Amazon is amazing. Their app works flawlessly their company performs flawlessly. It does appear that they have baked in shipping costs now on prime purchases. They're not the cheapest kit on the block anymore but they are well worth the money and use that we give it on a nearly daily basis.
1,Well the amazon official site offered me a $15 coupon for orders over $25 for the first and 2nd in app purchase if i downloaded the app. They did not give me either one of them. I got $10 off for my first in app purchase. So I got mad and uninstalled the app and cancelled my prime membership. I am just going to look at things I want to buy on amazon and buy them from the manufacturers websites where I can. Jeff Bezos is a flaming cheapskate that needs to go back in the closet.
5,Amazon has made my life so much easier and made things available to me that otherwise I would not be able to get. I can no longer drive and depend on others to help me to get to stores. Finding people that want or can help is in short supply so Amazon eliminates that and gives me back my independence. I like that Amazon also connects with local and small businesses giving everyone a fighting chance to make it in this competitive market. Returns are easy too!!!
2,"For real... get rid of those ""influencer picks"" videos, having some random person I've NEVER heard of and calling them an influencer to sell garbage products is a waste of space, data, and app performance. Might be one of the reasons that your app keeps crashing"
1,"Since the new update every time I click on an item it says we're sorry an error has occurred. I can't see prices, can't click on coupons and no item will fully load properly. As a prime member I would expect the app to work properly!"
4,"Quick, easy, convenient. But not giving 5 stars due to excessive cardboard packaging as most things come boxed and get put in an extra box, can't be good for the environment and nightmare getting rid of all the cardboard if you are a regular amazon shopper!"
1,"After years of use, Amazon suspended my account due to them not being able to verify my payment method. But I have been using this payment method for more than 3 years and have made purchases with it on Amazon more than once. I also sent my passport details and took a photo of my card with my first and last name, but Amazon does not respond to my messages and simply ignores it. The worst service I have ever used. I do not recommend anyone to deal with them."
2,"The 'saved for later' list under the basket, I get you're trying to be clever by loading the list dynamically, but most of the time it doesn't load my full list, sometimes it does if you scroll to the exact position that triggers loading the next items in the list, it's actually become very annoying."
5,"Love it! Super convenient with fast shipping. Easy returns and you can save tons of $$$$! Only advisory.... double check the seller you're buying from, look at their recent reviews. Which is why I try to only order from Amazon warehouses because it's guaranteed if the package gets lost or want to return."
2,Prime filter does not work. You would think for a company that charges for Prime membership and upcharges Prime eligible products so people still pay for shipping unknowingly would make sure this particular feature *does* work. No more saving time by not going to the store. Off to a real store I go.
2,Not to happy about the updated version version at all!!! It always goes right back to the home page when I'm on my personal search looking & I end up having to type my search item & start all over again on my item search! It's a waist of my time & ridiculously aggravating!
5,I love Amazon they have just about everything and I have never had anything lost. Yes I have never had anything lost. I did however get something stolen off my portch but they replaced it and it turned out good. I lost my job because of medical reasons and wish I could afford to shop again with them but I seem to be stuck in a big rut. Just like everyone else hopefully I will get out of it eventually. I say shop with Amazon they will make it good!
1,My Amazon account was compromised. No wonder. When giving all account permissions ok to open there are 67 damned jack legged sites approved and no way to pick and choose. Also they could not tell me who or when my account name was changed or the profile picture changed. I was on my own.
1,"WARNING: NEVER RELY ON THEIR ""RUSH"" SAME-DAY SHIPPING, its the best way to waste $3 and ensure youll never see your lackage. The company and app are both garbage! The likely underpaid, overworked Customer Service was very little help, and now the app won't even let me talk to customer service about the product Amazon lost, it's stuck in some loop that just keeps sending me back to my orders page. I will not be renewing my prime membership this year."
1,Amazon put me on Amazon Day and no way to remove. Why do I pay for a prime membership and they remove 2 day shipping at their whim. Customer Service can't change and can't remove in app. Contacted customer support and told I would be contacted. Never heard a word from them. So off we go to deal directly with businesses.
1,"This is the only app or store that I've ever used that continuously declines my payments after I resolve it it just happens again. Tired of hearing it's my bank when my bank said it isn't them. The best part is, my amazon prime never gets declined just my orders. Amazon can choke on it."
3,"I would love to keep the 5 stars but if I'm being honest I'm always disappointed with something when I order anything and I never get the delivery options advertised for my groceries, I always have to wait till the next day even if I make my order at 6am-9am. I don't have the ability to go to the store during the day because my husband is at work and I have 5 children 8yrs to infant. I rely heavily on the options given and the services provided. But still disappointed Everytime."
1,"As a seller, there is no means of contacting Amazon to fix their flubs. The search function is meh. I should have the means, as a shopper, to report objects using unrelated tags. If I put a brand name, obviously I only want that brand. Using """" or - should limit the search, just like it would on google. As a buyer, half the products are expired or exceptionally poor quality or misleading. I'm debating ending my membership."
2,You have to go to a desk top to see all channels you have subscribed to. They make it extremely difficult to edit your payment or to remove your card so that it doesn't get charged. The option to remove the card isn't there because Amazon wants to control your wallet. Literally.
5,"Amazon makes finding and getting general items easy and convenient. It cuts out having to travel from one store to another store for those specialty type items saving us time, money, and aggravation."
2,App of course allows you to order but haven't been able to view current or past orders for quite some time now. It's very frustrating to have to go to another device each time. Uh oh something went wrong!!
1,Great app. Fast delivery. Vast selection of products. Too much unnecessary pastic packaging though -1 ⭐️ Great Suggestion: add a search bar to saved items please. It would be so awesome and make things so much easier. I'll make 5 star when you do this (if you do this) please do this
4,I love shopping on Amazon and the app makes this super convenient. Some of personal account info is a bit hard to find and it takes a bit of experimenting to figure everything out at first but overall I really enjoy having and using the app.
1,New Alexa help is a joke. Want remove from app or Amazon page. Pops up and requires you to do something. Amazon says you can disable it but it want actually do that. And even trying to just ignore it it gets in the way an randomly open and requires you to do something so you can keep shoping.
1,"Amazon has removed the ability to get samples sent to Kindle. They have removed the ability to buy books, because they don't want to pay the Google tax. Thanks Amazon! I hope you maximize your profits by being greedy rentseekers."
2,"I like the prices... BUT! The support team don't pay any attention to what you explain when there is an issue. Today, the lawnmower I ordered came in, the bolt is defective and the nut won't go on all the way. When I tried explaining this to customer support, the not so intelligent person starts telling me to check power connections and fuse boxes... I said absolutely noth about whether or not it turns on. I have had nothing but issues with their support team"
2,"I uninstalled this app about a month ago because of frequent errors. I reinstalled it again today and am already experiencing issues with it. Too frustrating, so am uninstalling again and will just go back to using a regular browser to shop Amazon. Disappointing!"
5,"Great shopping app, fast shipping. I love that I can go onto the app and shop around for different things. My husband and I have ordered a bunch from amazon, and I love that the order can be tracked through the app as well as putting orders in"
1,"In the past few months amazon has become horrific. Terrible customer service since they took it from India, glitches with the app, poor quality merchandise, nearly impossible to get a refund, greedy, penny pinching new ways, and the icing on the cake--we can't buy digital books anymore on amazon kindle or on amazon. DUE TO THIS BS, I'VE CANCELED MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP PERMANENTLY. WILL NOT SHOP AMAZON AGAIN."
1,"Reprehensible... It seems my orders are late more often than not recently, I can't stand it anymore. When I order something, I want it in the usual 2 days!!! Not for it to be delayed for another 2! I really can't express my frustration enough with this, get better."
1,"1 star until they allow a default that doesn't use gift card, account credit and 5% credit taking more time to check out everytime. Stupid. Amazon is now making it harder than ever to find subscription management, see prices and manage subscriptions. Definitely still 1 star."
2,"App constantly pushes product pages instead of the places I need to go. For example, I am looking for order status, I am presented with a full size screen that I cannot close for a product I am not even interested in. If I try to go back, it will close the application or will take me to where I was previously but won't take me to the page I am looking for. Same thing happens when I try to go to the cart. Wants to sell me a blender and can add to cart but I can't even get to cart to checkout."
2,"Poor interface. When you're browsing the app and you hit 'view as website/desktop' once, there is no way to make it go back to an app interface which makes scrolling and searching much, much harder."
1,"This is one of those apps that you wish you could give zero Stars. 😔 I will never get back the hundreds if not thousands of dollars of lost items, wrong items sent, accidentally ordering more than one item and not getting a refund. They've taken a lot of money of mine unfairly."
3,"It was getting 5 stars but on June 20th they updated it and now 9 out of 10 times you cant see your orders and it shows it was a problem in their end. I reported it to the app developer through Amazon but they have not contacted me or fixed the issue so I have been buying stuff through Wayfair until they get off their bums and do something, at the very least respond"
5,"Excellent customer service, and after sale, well known around the world, international brands, has very minor glitches when it comes to some of the sellers not fulfilling their responsibilities or updating their products availability, but overall a wonderful safe place to buy whatever you can think of. Delivery is mostly accurate and in good condition ... overall I recommend Amazon shopping"
4,Why is it not possible to improve order filters?? There should be a filter for orders that are shipped but not recieved. This would save time and scrolling. This would allow you to see at a glance what items ordered are still to come.
1,"Amazon US has become a joke, several of my orders from Amazon us have been lost and 2 of them have been sent back to the Amazon US. I don't know why Amazon US has become so unreliable but I won't be shopping with this branch of Amazon until they get their stuff together, it's getting quite ridiculous and it's such a shame when they have such good deals."
3,"It's fine. I prefer the browser experience but sometimes it's good for a quick purchase. It's broken though because I can't always change my payment method, so I give up and wait till a computer is available."
1,"Delivery driver for my area is useless. Thick as anything. I used to spend a fortune with Amazon but now just use eBay. They always delivery on time and to the correct address. The Indian call centre at Amazon are also useless. Never listen to you properly and always say it will never happen again and guess what? It happened time and time again. Well, no more. I'm deleting my Amazon account."
2,Says enable bug everything I try to do it won't allow me to do and app crashes shut so can't update or open Amazon app. What am I missing....?!.
1,Search and navigation is PAINFULLY worthless. Search results in nothing but sponsored garbage and unrelated items. Prices are hidden and false scarcity tactics abound
5,"Quick, easy & colorful images! I'm pleased with the option of buying items. Thank You"
1,"Amazon decided to cancel an order and block my account for some reason. After that I followed the instructions to unblock it, filled all the info again (address, phone, payment method) and finally placed the same order. And they blocked me again and cancel my order with the same automated infomail. All in the span of 24 hours. Would not recommend"
1,It keeps switching to Spanish! Frustrating and the techs tell me to go to settings... BUT THEY'RE IN SPANISH! I hate it.
4,Would be a good app if you could change the language back to English once it changes for some reason.
1,"You can no longer preview songs you wish to purchase, due to the horrid Amazon music update."
2,Needs work. It annoying to subscribe to channels etc to find you can't watch the shows you purchased for. And cannot reach anyone to fix that. I see s10 Chicago fire but doesn't play?? Amung other shows I try watch. If it cannot play in my area why is it on my list? Do I get refunds for purchasing the channel that I cannot watch??
1,"I don't understand why it won't let me look at my orders it loads and loads , why won't it get fixed! AMAZON common man u guys make enough to fix a website!"
5,"Honestly, convenience is the key for using this app. It is easy to navigate and quite handy when you need to buy something on the fly. If you think of something while you are out and about, take out your phone, open the app and you could have what you need, in some cases, by that same evening. What more could one ask for?"
1,"Very disappointed with this app. It doesn't work at all. Constantly getting the window that says ""uh oh something went wrong on our end"" and customer service is of absolutely no help!"
2,Updated the app and it not working right I try search lowers to high or reverse an it does not work.an half the time I do search it give me junk that I'm I'm not search for. Hopefully they fix it. It was working better then I has in along time but going backwards again. I also hate they limit the number you can view by searching by price
1,"Amazon Prime Video sucks. If the NFL Continues to stream thru Amazon, I'm out on both!!!!!!! Can't be more pissed off than I am right now!"
2,"Updates take way to Long. Plus, there isn't a dark mode, and on top of that it'll barely work as I had to UNINSTALL IT MULTIPLE TIMES FOR IT TO WORK. And even then I had to keep signing in every single time. But it's better than ebay so they have that."
1,Over the last 3 months my prime 2 day shipping has turned into garbage packages are late 90% of the time I'm hoping Amazon becomes the next blockbuster with how terrible their service is getting
4,"What happened to this app since the last update everything is gone my wish list stuff that were in my shopping cart , my past orders it's really frustrating !"
2,"Not worth the money unless you like driving your returns to the UPS store. They used to send you a mailing label and UPS would pick it up at your residence or office. Now you have to drive it to a UPS Store, which for me is a 50 mile round trip. It's easier to deal with the sellers and pay shipping."
1,"Whatever you've done, undo it. Freezes my phone now. It was slow before but unusable Update: Now your app refuses to even open!!"
1,"Somehow my account switched to Spanish,I know it should be an option to switch back to English but ohh My Lord,Just can't find it,it was really easy before but now it has become a mission"
2,"This was a great app. I'm able to access it only in Spanish. For a little bit I could have it translated back into English. There doesn't seem to be any recourse for correction. I'm going to attempt to uninstall and reinstall. However if this persists, there is no reason to continue with Amazon prime."
5,"Just one piece of feedback. If ive already purchased something, can you stop showing me similar products? Not the best experience when everything you suggest as ""things I might like"" are stuff I already bought and no longer need."
1,"Canceled all my subscription and uninstalled. App is terrible and takes hours to rig to get what you want. Canceling my Amazon account! Last order of dairy cream was shipped from Maryland to Texas. Do you know what happens to cream when it's shipped that far, plus expiration date is 3 months away. It turned to a solid. It is not available for a return. Who is stupid enough to do that to a client?"
5,"Amazon is the best shopping experience I've ever had. No matter what I need to buy,I can find it on Amazon. If I buy the wrong size I can exchange it without any problem, if there's a problem with the merchandise I can either exchange it or call customer service and I have never had a problem getting my money refunded. Their representatives are kind and honest and helpful. As a disabled person I am and especially happy because they even have a special phone number for me to call and receive help"
1,"Charging more for worse service. Seller fees, user/customer fees all being jacked up. Yet now 2-day Amazon shipping is no longer a thing with prime. Garbage, greedy company."
2,"I had just opened Amazon not long ago to find everything in my cart and that was saved for later has been removed or something,but I'm not sure although before today I hadn't opened it for a little while and that may be why but it doesn't explain because I have gone months without opening the app and so I'm extremely confused and upset. What the hell happened?"
3,"""The Amazon Shopping app is no longer supported on this device."" This happened last night on my phone. I've used this app for years & has been super helpful. There are some things (returns, etc) that are better done on desktop, but for my normal shopping it's been great. Sad I can't use this app on my phone anymore."
5,"Very nice interface, fast, no issues at all, for real my favorite shopping app."
1,Horrible if I could give 0 stars I would they canceled my order saying it wasn't in stock yet it says it is then when I called to asked about the money I spent on it they tried to say they refunded it already but they didn't I even called my bank and checked my bank account the money was never put back in and when I was on the phone with them and told them that they hung up on me so now it seems there trying to steal money from people at this point
1,"Terrible app. No matter how many times I change my language settings, it reverts back to Spanish. It's slow, buggy and disorganized too. I'd award it zero stars if possible."
1,"Use to enjoy prime. Use to purchase and rent movies on TV often. Now I hate prime and am considering canceling the subscription I've had for many years. Can not rent or purchase anything since the update. If I could give negative stars, I sure would. Amazon get it together before you lose your valuable customers. Don't get prime if you are getting it for the videos. Not worth it since the update."
5,"Like AMAZON, so much to choose from, AWESOME customer service!!! Prices can not be beat."
1,"why can I no longer pull up my order history? seriously if I wanna spend money it works fine but I can't pull my orders up anymore. I have restarted my device, checked that nothing was running in the background and even forced closed the app and restarted the app. all of this while I have full wifi and full 5g even shut off the wifi to see if it was that. the order history on this app is the only thing that isn't working anymore."
1,What the hell that not showing item randomly like other shopping apps you must to open separate categories and choose the item so not to shop anything from amazon
1,Very disappointed that as an English speaking person this app doesn't allow you to select English language while in another country such as Mexico.
1,They dont hold third parties to expected standards... you can wait over a week for something not to get shipped... I was robbed. Cancelled my membership through the app 3 times!! Before they stopped charging me 4 it. And issue a refund on hold for a charge i did not make or approve. Also you can not archive or delete older orders from your order history.
1,An order that I literally just clicked purchase says it too late to cancel shipment in process BS Amazon rather was wages and time for me to return instead of cancel the order🤬 will start shopping elsewhere
1,"Why the hell would you think anyone wants to see ""Amazon influencers"" on a product page? Not only do I pay ungodly amounts for prime but you have the audacity to show dumb content down my throat. And it's completely unrelated to the product I'm even looking at. Pound sand. It's about to be at the point where convenience is no where near worth the privacy and ads I have to put up with. I'll just cancel prime and stop using Amazon soon at this rate."
1,"Even I write bad rate still the issue not solve I did contact the Amazon bad customer service and their supervisor they can not solve the issue also they can not access my account and they gave me very bad generically solutions to move the issue to spicalist team and they not respond, they put my account in hold for 4days and each days the review it one time , finally they not care about business and costumer."
2,None of the pictures or videos in the reviews load. It's been like that for a while now. It crashes at random. It's sluggish when scrolling to view the next item in a different color. Please fix this.
1,"Jesus Christ the Lord of the Rings ad almost had me uninstalling the app, if this becomes a regular thing I can guarantee you're going to lose a lot of customers."
2,Hello I have change my phone number and since just can't connect to.my account . Plus tiping for something in particular and the apps keep showing me anything but not what I ask for .. try to reach customer service when you can't connect or make long distance calls should be easier to reach the customer services on line or by mail Need improvement
2,invisible item is stuck in my cart. not in groceries. just some glitch. makes me nervous with the Walmart and PayPal scams I've gotten hit by.
1,"Have Amazon Prime, Late Delivery. I was supposed to receive a package on August 31st, 2022. Later that day, it said the package would be coming on September 2nd. I was fine with that since it was only a 2 day delay, but I was starting to get annoyed when the package didn't come at 8pm, which was the time Amazon gave me. At 11:09pm, I checked the shipping status of my package, and then it said ""Running Late, Now expected Sep 3 - Sep 8"". I am absolutely appalled, and furious. Would not recommend."
1,Gave me a full screen ad for the new house of dragon series when I opened the app. I'm already buying stuff all the time from amazon but now they wonna waste my time watching ads
1,My app no longer works while my Nord VPN is activated. Have to pause my VPN Then open app and it works! Not very secure if you asked me!
1,"This rating is for Amazon Fresh. I don't know what their issue is in Las Vegas but it's continuous. Not getting everything that was ordered, not having a sufficient amount of delivery times, having a driver sit at a house for over an hour while you items thaw, and then there's tonight. My items were supposed to be delivered between 10pm-12am, they were packaged and ready to go, but they were never assigned to a driver to actually be delivered. This was the last straw. Grocery store it is."
1,"Lately Amazon has been all scams and they know it, as long as they get their share they don't care. Walmart is much better and safer."
2,The app used to be good... but now pages take a long time to load.. and forget prime two day shipping... every order recently has been delayed multiple days
2,"Please bring the former app features back. I was forced to update and now no longer have easy access to my cart, existings orders, lists and other app features that made purchasing a more streamlined process. Rather convoluted and time consuming now. Not happy with it."
3,Can't login because there's no place to add new #? Why would people think that pH #'s don't change. So if my number is different from when I signed up there's no way for me to receive text msgs to help sign in? Now that I have browsed the app and read other experiences from other users it seems as if I'm not the only one having problems. Amazon should fix these problems!
2,Search feature available on reviews on some items but not otherd. Many items have doubled or tripled in price within the last year (far higher than inflation can account for). And prime membership is now outrageously expensive. Fewer and fewer items offered with 2day shipping.
3,Has some trouble loading from time to time. Really sad that this is the only way I can buy the books I enjoy and not straight from the Kindle app.
1,"Will not show my orders anymore. Says no internet. Funny how I had internet to get in the app. Took a star away. Rapidly becoming useless. Coburg get the ""Uh Oh, something went wrong on our end"" message."
4,I love shopping in amazon. But everytime I sort on this app some of the items disappear. I hope they fix it.
1,"Cancelled a preorder before amazon shipped, they are holding funds over a weekend preventing me from making real world purchases like groceries and gas. Not cool. No more preorders."
5,"I like this app.... also it's been convenient so far to get some products I've wanted, fast and efficient. I wish they would lower the cost to get an Amazon card tho, look at how much I purchased and how often, it will still work out good for them to reward ppl like me a card to shop more often. All an all I'd recommend them over their competition 💯👍🏾"
1,App is so laggy! I wish I could use it. I really love Amazon's fast shipping but I can't take advantage of it because I can't buy anything if all I keep getting is errors. I'm considering cancelling my membership since I'm hardly able to use the features of the membership.
2,They need to put the app back to the old way was easier to navigate and the new way is glitchy and hard to look thru
2,"Doesn't play well with my vpn. Constant hangs, stalls, and the dreaded ""something has gone wrong."" I mean, dogs are cute and all, but I'd much rather get my shopping done. Can't help but think that Amazon does not prioritize providing service to people who are trying to anonymize their traffic as much as possible. But that's just my musings. Oh, and the search is the worst thing since the days of Dogpile."
1,very bad . i have 2 month ago new accont .but last week i have one sd card oder i have pay for sd card . today i will check my account suddenly today i have no account and amazon will my private document for login why ? i dont want more amazon ebay best for Germany. for login my document this is very bad shopping aap 👎👎👎👎
2,Please fix the errors.... Everytime I click on a product it says sorry an error occurred please refresh the page but it won't let u refresh through the app. But when u close the app and go back in still the same thing... Also I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled the app thinking that would help but no it didn't. This error still occurs... Please fix asap......
1,I used to like this app but they changed how the filter works and I can't find the star ratings and lowest price. Jesus Christ people when an app works leave it the hell alone ........
1,"Undo your update that forces me to use Amazon.CA. It doesn't let me process orders, tells me my address is invalid, and doesn't have any order history despite ordering through you."
3,"Hi, Please kindly provide us with System Light/Dark Mode for this must have App. Its a shame other shopping Apps such as Ebay etc have this most requested feature. I'll do 5 Stars if the Developers grant us this request. Thanks."
1,I hate this app. I live in Mexico but speak English this app will not allow English nor will it allow google translate...plus the chat and the phone service is in only Spanish.
1,What is going on with this amazon company? The amazon devices man😡 you take control over it and what? Lose wins. Its so terrible now that i really want it to improve and really tell me. WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU NOT LETTING ME DO ANYTHING ON THIS DEVICE!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠. Like on brawl stars where i somewhat lag out and y ou know idle because of you!!!! Amazon devices are somewhat to me a waste of money. Like why on earth did you download an app calles freevee but all of this is 16+!?!
4,Google: Let's help people by allowing them to block notifications from any app. App devs: Let's install a bell within the app that only we control. The people: Well we almost had a life without notifications.
1,I do a NOT pay $140 a year for you to STILL force STUPID ADS on me EVERY TIME I OPEN YOUR APP! I could not care less about your dumb Lord of the Rings show and the fact that you feel that it's necessary to force me to watch the SAME AD for it over and over every single time i open the app with NO option to opt out?!?! What am I giving you all this money for if it's not to have an ad-free experience?! This is the stupidest thing your marketing team has ever done. Your users do NOT want this.
1,"Dreadfully app. It repeatedly shows dozens of items unrelated to my searches, to the sacrifice of the items of interest which justs wastes my time. Applying filters makes it go from bad to worse. Shame on you Amazon."
1,Ads unwanted notifications everywhere. Still can't find off where to turn off all the notifications: hi we want to advertise to you
1,"The slowest app on the world on my phone, don't have any issues with any app except Amazon. Also literally had the least intuitive UI on the planet, it's like they want users to get lost"
1,"Unless you pay them the ever increasing prime membership, you can safely add several days to whatever ""promised delivery day"" amazon claims. I'll order from some place that doesn't make drivers have to decide between keeping a job or pissing in a van"
1,"still broken half of the time. when i click on the account tab or cart tab, it takes me to a random page and i cannot access the cart at al through the app"
5,Love getting things at my doorstep! I Pettit & love getting them there! Much better in my book than Chewy!! Chewy is good but takes longer to deliver & some things are higher!
1,For some reason it won't let me check out. Even with buy it now option. Just refreshes the screen over and over. Never had a problem before.
1,"Bad app, bad company, horrible customer service. Raised the price on my subscribe and save and removed my coupons while I was updating my order. Customer service is no help at all, the chat through the app sucks. Almost every delivery is late and they do not care about their ""guaranteed"" deliveries anymore. I barely even use Amazon anymore because of their horrible business practices, time I cut them out for good, much better and cheaper options that are less scummy than this awful company."
1,Was good now poor! Can't buy an ebook without having access to a terminal. It is the same with audiobooks. My Barns and Noble app doesn't have this problem. It's really a pain when you're stuck in a hospital without access to your home computer.
5,"If the Amazon app were any less good, I'd be surprised. Just wish that the workers behind the scenes at the warehouses we're paid more."
2,"500 words is not enough... I've found that most things under $50 dollars usually are pretty worthless, I've returned probably more than I've kept. That being said, I'm expected to pay for products, then when I return something that any normal person would return, I get to be passed around from so called customer service associate to associate just to be repetitively told different things. There is no consistency, and they truely do no not give a damn about the customer so it seems most of the ti"
2,You can't cancel subscriptions with this app. But you sure can add them. Sneaky sneaky Amazon. please add this function
1,"Terrible ""update"" Why do app developers feel the need to screw up something that works fine!? I can't look up past or pending orders because the app won't load that page. I can't go to my profile because the app won't load the page. And why move all those menu items to the bottom!? This update is a huge step backwards."
3,"Amazon has been slowly getting worse and worse. As of late, I've been getting many more delayed packages, lost packages, etc. Amazon used to go the extra mile to remedy these situations. Now that they own the market, they slipped into complacency. One bad UX here and there means so nothing... So why care?... Is the attitude."
4,Most of the time everything works out. Very seldom do not receive my packages which could easily be logistical issues. Aside from the sketchy prime membership household thing. I love the options Amazon has to offer.
1,"What has gone wrong with Amazon? App is total garbage now. Cant see my orders anymore, cant search my orders, shopping pages take forever to load when you click on them! App was not broken, stop trying to fix something that's not broken! AMAZON PLEASE FIX THIS. You are one of the largest companies on the planet and your app doesnt work?"
1,"Every time this APP comes up, it's in Spanish. I've changed it to English at least 25 times but it still comes up in Spanish."
1,"Package was supposed to be delivered Sunday and wasn't. On Tuesday I got a message on the app that it had been delivered. Again, it wasn't. But because the carrier marked it as delivered, Amazon customer service said I had to wait until Wednesday to see if it turns up. Wednesday came and went with no package. Customer service says they can send out another package (at no cost to me, how nice of them). I'm done with the thieves at Amazon."
3,"No past or current orders shown. As other people have said, it stopped showing my orders, which are still visible on a web browser, and the customer service told me ""just use the web browser then""... Reinstalling fixed it (which the customer service agent did not suggest, but still pretty bad bug)."
3,"I loved my amazon app (RIP). It is broken now, I can't sort, see my orders, see my cart, etc. It was 5 stars but now it is 1 star."
1,Moved and now the app no longer does the map tracker. Sometimes it doesn't even do any notifications. Everything is updated for the app. Not sure why it's not working the same.
1,"App filters searches bringing up selected products to be pushed. Web browser search is much less restrictive. This provides much more product control to the consumer. Updated June 2022: - one more star. You are not allowed to download a receipt here, you must do this on the desktop site. Full service app this is not, this app just allows you to buy stuff."
1,Very bad service... While changing location I have to pay membership fee even I had membership in different country for claim free delivery... its ridiculous.....
2,"Unable to update app even though I have tried many many times. I cannot use the app because the app automatically forces me to into the update page... this one, but won't update this or other Amazon apps on my Android. Very frustrating. I cannot even uninstall this app either not happy"
1,"An order seems to have been lost, I waited almost a month at this point. Amazon finally allows me to request a refund, but there is no way to do it. Just keeps putting me in a ""chat feature"" that's running in circles!"
5,"Love this game! I'm enjoying the new way to earn more higher priced items and game cash, and diamond's. This way you can get more keys to be able to complete your home room's on the top. I would like to see some of the design room's have 2 keys instead of always just 1."
1,"SSSSSLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW if it even works at all... If you're feeling nostalgic for the days of dialup you should totally download this app. I personally love staring at a blank screen for 2-3 minutes before being shown a picture of a dog with the message that ""something went wrong on our end"" when all I want to do is check on an order that you haven't sent me any updates on despite me specifically picking that option.... You can take this app and stick it all up in your wrong end."
3,"I find now with Amazon that the prices are alot higher than eBay, aswell as you think things are cheaper,then you pay sometimes as much in postage as you do the item! And I was an Amazon prime member,but finding things as it's not all items! That are covered by Amazon prime is ALOT more difficult! So I don't really buy from Amazon now"
1,"Worst experience from amazon,I have ordered shoe on 4 Nov and estimated delivery date at first was 7 Nov ,after that they extended itself to 13 Nov and till now no any messages and calls ,very much disappointed with their service ."
2,"Now that they integrate Amazon music whenever I try to buy digital music it forces me to use a desktop to purchase digital music. Poor experience. I don't want to pay for a music subscription, I like to own what I buy."
5,"Amazon. I order every week. Multiple times a week. I look for specific products sold overseas. I get them next day or within 2 days. I couldn't be happier with your service however, Prime Day has me perplexed. Why on earth would you not run Prime Day through a Friday. The majority of Americans get paid Friday. I was so excited to order with a discount on almost everything. Now yet another year goes by without being able to order on Prime Day because I get paid Fridays. Keep up the hard work."
1,It's always been excellent but this prime day I was unable to make any purchase as something went wrong page was the majority of the time consistently adding ide feeling
1,The app does not have a share product with friend option. What kind of a monkey would program a store app that does not allow you to share product links?
3,"Rush delivery is a lie(not literally, just being dramatic), you pay for it to be delivered that day or the next(even though I didn't actually pay extra, it was free). You get it two to four days later(was meant to be deliver same day, I completely understand late delivery). I could've gone and picked it up at the store, I really should've went to the store. It's too late now, frik. My fault for being lazy and not going to the store, I went cheap and decided to have someone else do the driving."
2,"Damn app now uses too much battery power just to shop. I shouldn't have to keep charging my phone because you idiots at both Amazon and Google don't seem to know anything about power efficiency once you lose oversight of your own mess. If I wanted my phone to drain fast like a bat out of hell, I would be playing games on my phone. I shouldn't have to quickly lose battery power just to browse on this app, let alone all other apps."
4,I like it because all the free shipping with sub and you get TV with it I don't like where Amazon is politically they for sure are not on my side.
1,Now nearly unusable... Impossible to make simple purchase easily.. Keeps interfering with suggestions. Gets worse every update
2,My Orders is nonfunctional 90% of the time for the last ~2mo. Ridiculously frustrating. Constantly locks in a refresh loop or throws error messages or just won't load at all. I never thought I'd get tired of seeing photos of dogs...
5,If you need something you got a 99.9% chance the Amazon will have it Top Notch service excellent return policy and had other added benefits such as Prime video and subscribing in my opinion you can't go wrong
4,"So far, I have been pleased with my Amazon experience. I had ordered a bathing suit and put it aside until I went on vacation. On vacation, I tried to put it on and couldn't get it much past my knees.It is a size XR. I needed and ordered a 2X. I have no idea how to return for either a credit or exchange. Help with this problem is needed. Thank you for your help."
1,Amazon doesn't let you know when they removed items from your ordered and paid inventory. out of no where my order disappeared with all the information for tracking it was on my list for when it was supposed to arrive then it all disappeared and I'm very 😡 upset and disappointed 😞 hopefully my money $$$ is back to my original payment method
1,"Weird glitch on the app. In the Cart section, buttons like 'Save For Later' or 'Move To Cart' don't work and just refreshes the page. Sometimes 'Add To Cart' doesn't work either. You have to restart the app to get it to work properly."
3,"The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is because of the ridiculous way the app is setup makes it IMPOSSIBLE to DIRECTLY contact someone at customer service!! I've been trying to contact customer service in regards to an order I placed, purchased but never received over 2 months ago."
1,"Doesn't work on Samsung tablet S7. Login problem for hours trying to login. Both Amazon shopping telling ""check internet connection"", but Amazon for tablets telling login error. Changing password not helping. Uninstalling and installing again not helping. It works good on my Samsung phone S9"
1,"Amazon's decision to not allow purchasing on the Kindle ap is a pain. You like a sample and wish to purchase it, normally you would purchase right then. Now you have to go to another place and try to find and try to buy, after being told several times this ap doesn't support buying books. Thank you Amazon for your lack of good service."
1,"The app sucked before, but they went back to the drawing board, and in group discussion, found a way to make it suck even more."
1,"All of my information disappeared. All my saved items, buy again items, items in cart, ect. It's just my account with my card"
1,Huge problem I have a email that I set up for Amazon business and I canceled and still money was taken out for it I lost 85.52 for it and I don't even remember paying that much in the first place
2,Good App....But they definitely need improvement on the customer service feedback regarding placing True Honest Reviews. Seems like some bias going on with Amazon restricting people from giving reviews. I contacted them twice recently about my account being restricted from giving reviews..but no response
5,"There are so many online shopping apps available but, Amazon is my fave by far. It's so easy to return products when they don't fit website description. No questions asked. Just be honest of course. After all, honesty is still the best policy when buying products online."
1,App keeps crashing everytime you try to watch any videos of the product from product description. Please fix this!
1,This app has gotten horrible it keeps freezing up and taking me back to the home page and then I have to start the whole process over. About to give up my membership and shop some where else very disappointing. Need to fix asap.
1,"I buy lots of computer parts from all the big stores, Canada Computers, Best Buy, Newegg and Amazon.... All of the other sellers are professional enough to send me a return label when I have received a non functional oor damaged item, I don't live close to the post and it will cost me money and time to go into town. They sold me broken non functional product and now want me to waste my time and money to correct the problem. I will stick to the professional stores that make it right!!! BYE!"
3,Can't ever pull up my orders and it takes forever for anything to load. Always tells me there is a problem and puts me back on the home screen. No matter how many times I clear everything out and uninstall and reinstall it I still have issues.
1,"This is the worst market app I've used. You search for products, 90% of the search results are currently not available. 60% of the available ones are not direct fit for the selected car. Why did it ask for my car if it still shows products for other cars? Such a useless app."
4,"Great app but just slow, laggy, and after being on it for like 10 mins it gets really buggy and stops scrolling and can't tap anything unless I get off and back on or save the tab and get back on the tab."
1,Sign up for free shipping. It's agreed and then they turn around and charge you for shipping. I'm out. Getting a differant cc. Kiss my butt amazon
1,"They want you to review the products, but when you give an accurate review they block you from posting. I never used any foul language in my reviews so it wasn't for that."
2,"I would LOVE to see emy previous orders, but every time I try to open them the screen refuses to load. I can operate the ""buy again"" section but it's actually impossible to navigate ""my orders"" ... please fix this, it hasn't worked in MONTHS"
1,"If it wasn't for the free delivery, I would have canceled Amazon eons ago. I'd bet 50% of their content is woke rubbish. You can't even sit through there political propaganda movies anymore. It's just a waste of time. The left manages to ruin everything they touch."
1,"The one thing I need from this app is not working: I cannot get auditory/vibrating push notifications no matter what I do, only silent alerts. Since Amazon couriers never ring my doorbell, I wouldn't know if a package was delivered unless this app informed me, and I simply don't notice the quiet alerts. (BTW I have no problems enabling sound/vibration alerts with other apps, just this one.) Please, please, Amazon Shopping developers, fix this app. I just need NOTICEABLE push notifications."
3,"I'll be honest, I'm not at all a Tolken, nor LOTR fan. Is there anyway I can skip/turn off the ad for this new Lord of the Rings show; everytime I open the app?"
1,"I used to love this app, until i tried to search for a book, i am flooded with kindle electronic books. Those are NOT BOOKS! it is just the text of the book. Why can't I exclude kindle books when searching? Why am I forced to search through 50 billion fake books before i find one actual, physical book? And it should be easier to find the option to recharge credit to my phone. It is extremely silly to have it buried that deep in the app. Why not an icon on the user home screen?"
1,"What's really annoying is that when I'm t|trying to see the list of ""saved for later"" it's painfully slow to load because its making suggestions for other purchases. But rather than helping me buy what I've already looked at its wasting my time and also limiting rather than aiding the sales for amazon.... 🤔"
2,"I don't know what is going on but the last 2 times I've placed an ordered using this app, my order never went through. I have had to order a second time which, in turn, makes my delivery date later than anticipated. It's just frustrating."
1,Why would you force a lord of the rings ad at the beginning of opening the app.. put it on the home page I don't mind but now you are preventing me from using your app to shop... what it was actually meant for
3,oftentimes difficult to find items. Amazon makes it very difficult to log out of the application
4,"Amazon basically has everything I need and being a Prime member has its benefits too. I rarely have problems with my orders except for the Amazon contract drivers...they never follow my delivery instructions. Overall, I'm glad I accidentally signed up for it."
1,"Do not sign up for Prime. It has become greatly devalued. They failed the same item I ordered 3 times in a week and lied they were going to watch it very closely. You no longer get items in two days for Prime. I just placed an order today July 14th, and it will not be here until July 24th. Buh-bye Amazon, this is what happens when a company gets too big and loses its great customer service. As soon as my membership is up I'm moving on. You can't use Covid 19 as an excuse."
1,"Slow as cold molasses, it never gets any better By the looks of the latest reviews not many have anything positive to say about it !!!"
1,This app is so dodgy. On the browser it tells you to go to the app to chat if you want to contact Amazon but once you install it there is nowhere to start a chat.
1,"I detest the redesign. I detest the financing payment options that cannot be disabled, and are prominently featured before actual payment methods. I detest the floating Alexa garbage that I will never use on purpose. Bring back the old UI."
4,Would like to see returns in a separate section and the price I paid on orders retained for reference. Shopping is effortless.
3,Please stop dealing with emirates post. They have my address yet they keep annoying me about the address. I hate that amazon does not update location based on gps. I have multiple places..and i find myself send items to wrong places...other apps has better location detection features
1,"App now shows no order history, order alerts or anything and defaults to the first address listed not your chosen address and there's no way to track."
5,I have consistently had good experiences with Amazon. Products of good quality 8 out of 10 times.
5,Shopping made simple so much better than having to schlep through stores dealing with crabby people and sales clerks Then not finding what you are looking for. Amazon presents the opportunity of finding what you want and sometimes a better one all you have to do is browse from the comfort of an easy chair and not changing out of your pj's
1,"I cant find a way to look through a specific sellers items, or search for that individual seller for some reason. The search results are now showing in thumbnail pairs, instead of clearly 1 item per line.. Now it's 1 item per line but the line takes up 10 lines..."
1,"They add items to my lists without my consent. Also cannot now purchase anything without signing up to ""free"" Prime for one month. When I declline and leave the Basket they spam my email account with ""reminders"" that I need one more step to purchase Prime. I don't want Prime and I don't want spam."
4,I really like this app the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because almost every time I go to look at my orders it will never load and I can't see where the packages are in transit or anything and it gets very annoying. I'm not sure if it's just my phone or a common issue but it's done it for a good year now.
1,"Says that delivery is 2 stops away then arrives hours later, what is the point in having a notification system if it is never correct."
2,2022 Amazon is losing their edge. they take the amaz from the zon and basically why am I paying for something i can get the same price for at target. Not the apps fault but I'm speaking up.
5,love Amazon been shopping there for years since 2016 make an order sometimes you get it the next day and free shipping most of the time prices are good just got to do your research thank you Amazon
1,"I had to install this app to talk CS after cancelling Prime 3 time in 3 days and still getting charged, I was informed that I did cancel but I didn't cancel the auto renewal so every time I cancel it just added it self back. Essentially it's a parasite for your bank account that keeps coming back."
1,"Delivery notes can be removed to streamline app and save us time since drivers don't read them, Alexa sux, tracking doesn't update sometimes, vehicle info convenient for finding parts, reviews are troll, slow, refreshes and makes you lose your place, lies about shipping as it changes after placing orders"
4,I am having trouble ordering on this page it hasn't been working for 2 days now. I cannot get it to load at all - Update 6/22/2022 Amazon Shopping has been working pretty good for me so far. It has it's hangup every now and then but it is a pretty good app. 😊❤️
1,"2022 UPDATE STILL BROKEN! 2021 UPDATE. Charges 5 times more than anyone else on food products, check it yourself. After being a very active customer. Amazon is letting a seller rob me! Ive always had good things to say about Amazon until i now. When i actually needed them to help protect me, they refused! I ordered an item and never got what i paid for, Amazon said they wouldn't help me! They don't appreciate me as a long time customer!!!!"
1,"Just updated the app and now I get a blank screen when I choose the 3 bar button and the person button. Since I updated and the layout changed I don't know what these are. I uninstalled the app, didn't change anything. Is it really that slow now??"
2,The home page is not acting correctly and keeps going to a different page. Everything stops loading on home page.
2,"It glitches, blinks and then shuts down. Doesn't give the option to update."
4,Great experience and I'm finally glad that I'm starting to use the app for shopping makes life just a little bit more convenient and easier when necessary👍😏
2,Could be a better app if it had a dark mode option in the app settings. This is 2022 make that a thing. Trying to shop when you can't sleep and not wanting g wake your spouse up would be great but Amazon even with screen dimmed all the way is bright enough to light the whole room which is stupid as hell.
1,"The app switched to Spanish when it was alway English. I eventually found a way to change it back to English, but it immediately becomes Spanish again. No clear fix. Also pushes ads through notifications."
4,"Great app, minus one issue. You cannot buy ANYTHING in secret or discreetly if you have any family members etc on your account. We purchased some items that we wanted to keep secret and private from a member of our family, I archived the orders BUT, this only removes it from the order screen. Everyone still gets tracking and status notifications. There is no way to fix this according to Amazon service. Of course the family member saw the purchase and father's day suprise is wasted. Aggravating."
1,App doesn't let me do anything it keeps closing and reopening. I guess Amazon doesn't want my money cause I can't do anything on the app so I can't spend money!
1,"Horrible shipping, i had 2 day shipping and they keep changing my date its been almost a week and i haven't gotten my package and i cant cancel my order cause its already with the carrier but they have had 5 days. Then they say contact the carrier and there is no way to get in contact with ups its a remidial operated system. Never shopping here again. Dont recommend it there are better prices online."
1,"This App stopped working yesterday & I haven't been able to use it since. I've cleared the cache, I've uninstall & reinstalled, but still nothing but a blank screen or the amazon header with blank screen. Please get it sorted soon."
5,"Amazon's customer service is top notch. They have always went above and beyond, whenever I've had an issue with any purchase. I don't know if it's because I order so often, or because I rarely have an issue, but the reps always go above and beyond for me."
1,"Why does this app not have dark theme? Everything is too dang bright, it hurts my eyes. I have to uncert the colors everytime I open this app."
5,They have quality products at great prices and their shipping is fast. They stand by their merchandise. Refunds if necessary are easy. Lots of selection in all categories!
1,Amazon needs to get rid of sellers. Sellers cancelling orders and to get a refuntvyou need to go tru seller. Amazon getting to be like ebay.
1,I don't appreciate being made to download an app just to contact customer services. You could easily make this available in the browser.
1,"Had two orders that never arrived to my house. One went missing and a refund wasn't given. The other, about the same. No refund, no product, left me unsatisfied completely. Not to mention that I asked for next day delivery, and they still have the audacity to not deliver my package. I think I lost an extra £3 somehow. Ridiculous."
1,"The app now forces you to sit through multiple full screen video ads as you navigate. Truly horrible design, it makes me want to uninstall it and solely use Amazon through my desktop web browser."
1,"Filters don't work...... Typed men's shoes / price low to high/ under $25 ..... Got pages and pages of $150 shoes ...... Similar things happen w,/other products to ... It's a moto g stylus phone I use."
3,The current update is NOT an upgrade. Rather downgrade. I'm going to uninstall the current update and see if I can get the previous Amazon app Unhappy in Florida the uninstall didn't bring the previous app back. The main page doesn't open. Or it hasn't opened in the last 15 minutes. Hey Amazon. Time to hire a better IT technicians. The current ones are going to put Amazon out of business
1,"Don't trust amazon they allow shady companies to sell on their website do not make it clear it is a 3rd party seller then when that company steals from you amazon is just like oh well. A to z guarantee is fake and does not work, not 1 single time have they sided with me when I have received damaged items and while seller claims on Amazon to offer free returns but then charges me to return the damaged item or item never shows."
3,Sometimes it works but most of the time the drivers don't pay attention to your notes on delivery. Also in the past 6 months I have had spoiled food damaged packages and leaks. One delivery a large box was ripped open and set on the floor in my building. A couple pieces were missing. I'm sick and tired of complaining. It appears no one is taking action to resolve these issues.
5,I like shopping on Amazon because I can find unique items that I cant find in stores. Delivery is usually right on time and I am happy with my puchases 98 % of the time. If I need to return something i just take it to Kohls. Five Stars!
3,"This app sucks. For such a huge inventory and how much filthy dirty money amazon is making, you know they can do better than this. Dam there's probably elementary kids that could do better executing a functional app"
3,This app tries to not work for tablets but your app for tablets doesn't allow you to search from a directory or listing. This app just wants to show you where you have browsed before. So if you want something new you can not go directly to it.!!! Why is Whole Foods now only accessable online with great effort?????
4,"Wish I could feel better about how much the amazon drivers and amazon warehouse workers are paid - unfortunately it's not nearly enough. I do like getting my items generally on time at a great price! Again though, my last order has gone totally haywire... from being just 500 miles away to suddenly going the opposite direction over halfway across the country. Maybe next time fantastic service (I hope?!) again..."
1,"Normally it is a great app, but I ordered something Monday then Tuesday, and was supposed to receive the orders Wednesday and Thursday, but Wednesday I got an alert that I had to confirm my payment information and that my orders were canceled and will be 4 days late. Their is no reason it couldn't have asked me when I ordered them and it is upsetting and poorly designed. I am very upset."
1,Amazon has failed to deliver my previous purchase of the same items and failed to address the fact that the driver walked out my building with my l purchased items and failed to investigate what happened even though I contacted Amazon straight away and many hours later and several phone calls from me having to explain time and time again what happened still no resolution. Absolutely appalling and disssapointing service.
2,I hate the new app icon and poor operation. The recent update is horrible. The menu and options are not as functional. They are slow and hard to use. The original version was much better!
5,Amazon costumer service is great very helpful and kind and if you don't get your package they refund your money and they are so nice I'm happy with Amazon 🙂
5,"Although I don't purchase any items it's very convenient for finding items and materials for my clients to purchase for my renovation business and Amazon is good about suggesting and staying within the category of my projects by posting items that are compatible or compliments the already purchased items which makes it easier to design a restroom, kitchen etc. Interiors or exterior projects"
1,"Amazon does not care about their customers, there was a fraudulent account opened for my son with his debit card. Amazon charges keep cleaning out his debit card acct and they won't help us even to get into the acct and get it shut off. Appearantly it's not their policy to help fix acct issues whether they are fraudulent or not. Great policy Amazon, thanks for all the help!"
1,"Can't do same day delivery, so I need Instacart, also massive -- UNSKIPPABLE ads for their video products. If I wanted to see those I would go to that app. Stop it. Deleted and only using the website from now on."
3,"Would be great if my list didn't unsort every time I changed something, such as priority. It's annoying when I change something and go back to my list and have to sort everything again and again just to know what priority everything is."
2,It was five stars until Google got greedy and now I can't buy any digital content through a shopping app. This is ridiculous and used to be the majority of my purchases on this app were digital books. Now you can no longer purchase any digital books or movies on this app or the Kindle app. Apple is apparently just as bad with their greed. So much rage.
5,"I love the upgrade, no matter what app.you hit watch list on ,Amazon keeps them on the home screen so you don't have to open each app. to find the movie you want to watch later,great minds!!🤯"
1,"The worst customer service. If your product arrives damaged or faulty, Amazon doesn't care at all. I have been trying to return a faulty product but nothing happens. Whenever I call the customer service, I get assured that the order will be picked up but all lies. I will never use this website again."
1,"As other reviewers have stated, there doesn't seem a way to disable the harassing push notifications that the Amazon app shovels. I get all of the notifications that I don't want and none of the ones that I want. This app is out of control. The only way to fix it is to uninstall it and just use an internet browser to sign into Amazon."
5,Easy to search for and review items of interest. Ordering and shipping...easy and fast!
1,The app crashes every time I try to use it. The only way I can access Amazon now is to go through an internet browser.
2,Amazon ae . Needs more They think there is no issue to sell items they don't have. Then you wait and wait without getting your goods.
5,"Great stuff for great prices, and the site will even find the lowest price FOR you. Easy pay, super fast, reliable delivery. Rewards credit card. Can't think of s downside, except it could be addictive. Ten stars!"
4,Reads my mind. No frustrating typing a product name because I bought before. Its easier than goimg to the store. I really like this app.
5,Very convenient! Tho in one point they had failed me to change my address and customer service couldn't even do it til that I have to cancel my order that I need it so bad! But its all good.. overall experience I am still satisfied..
1,"Is it the biggest online shoo in the world ?!?!?!? No proper filtering nothing I search for laptop an the option i got is ; what brand, Amazon shop?! And I want to see the order and it's missing ! Also the turkey shop doesn't support English language and LITTELERLY it has nothing in it. Cheapest most outdated stuff is in here. Just delet it after 5 minutes experience."
1,Super pissed at this lotr ad every single time I open the app. Do better. It's insanely frustrating.
1,Worst app ever! Not easy to navigate around with a ridiculous amount of just unnecessary options not to mention its ridiculous to find the spot to actually log out of your account. Finally found delete my account section soo went ahead and did that! Good bye and good ridden Amazon hate everything about you!🖕
1,"When u order something instead of taking the money out of ur account right then and there like any normal place of business does, they say ur order is complete but don't actually take the money till it ships. so if u're like most ppl working paycheck to paycheck u have to worry for like a week if there's still enough money to cover ur purchase whenever it finally decides to charge u. The most ridiculous, trash system ever. When I want to pay for something I want to pay now not a week from now."
1,"So many fake reviews and customer service agents aren't being helpful. I received a defective item, and Amazon only gave me 1 day to return after I made a return request!!! I didn't know that the return time is this short, so I returned it late. Amazon insisted to charge me a restocking fee/late return fee on this item. I thought Amazon had a good return policy, but I was wrong. Agents aren't being helpful at all, all of their answers are generic."
1,"I have been tricked by Amazon into downloading their App. They sent me a £10 promotional voucher to download and use their app, so I placed an order, but my order arrived damaged/faulty. I have now got to return the item for a refund, but Amazon will not reissue me the £10 voucher, so I'm now deleting their App, and will never use Amazon again."
1,"Error message since yesterday, unable to order, track parcels just an apology and go to home page, then that won't load."
1,"Terrible service. I ordered several items to my hotel and last item was arrive, they claimed delivery on hold due missed info address. This purely incorrect, it is the same address I ordered other items and they all arrived. When talked to customer service they claimed wrong address in the carrier and asked me to call the carrier and resolve it. I refused to do that and then the customer service promised to delivery within 2 days. These 2 days passed, delivery did not arrive."
3,PLEASE READ AMAZON... your app is jumping all over the place since last update and pics are taking ages to load and if you dont fix i will take my shopping elsewhere as its becoming hardwork to veiw anything
2,"The company, not the app. Twice I ordered a backpack for my child, first time, i waited a month with no tracking updates, they claimed it was delivered, never showed up. Second one I ordered at the end of July, last tracking info I got was from August 19th stating it arrived in flight, no further updates and amazon is not helping me find out what is going on. They lost another package of mine and would only replace the scoops and not the slippers too. All 3 screw ups within the last 2 months"
1,The app at least works better than the shipping. Don't expect your merchandise to be delivered anywhere near to on time. Greedy b@$t@rd$ can't do anything right...
5,Excellent And High Quality App. Just about as close to perfect as shopping app can get.
4,"Ummm, this app randomly changed the language settings to Spanish. Unless of course mine is possessed as well. Could you please address this issue? Otherwise, I've never had any other issues."
3,Don't always think you're getting the best deal from Amazon when you come a lot of times find it a lot cheaper and local stores than that I had that problem many of times with Amazon returning stuff I hate doing it with Amazon you order stuff from them they say they'll be there in a few days and a day later oh you have to make different payment arrangements after they charge your credit card and stuff it just Amazon is getting very terrible not worth it anymore
4,I order something to Amazon and ended up in the hospital for a couple weeks when I trying to find out what happened to my package I had problems getting back into the app and it wouldn't allow me to access your location of my packing the tracking number was totally different than anything they had in the mailing hubs in Portland area. Still trying to figure out what happened to my package?
1,"Unusable when you're abroad, will show the language of the country you're connecting from. Even though my phone is English, the site configuration is in English, it still translates everything into Spanish."
1,"I want to give this 5 stars, but I'm giving 1 because it is absolutely INSANE how Amazon hides the sign-out button. It should be right THERE, in front of me, maybe 1 click away. But no, I have to click on 3 lines, scroll to the bottom, click on settings, scroll to the bottom, and there's Sign-Out. I hope with 1 star, this generates attention. In this day and age where cyber security is so important, this is a HUGE flaw."
2,"App lags now. Also, product videos won't load. Tried reinstalling but nothing works."
5,"Yes, Amazon does have its days where it doesn't want to work, or if you order something on a computer or laptop your order dosen't save. But overall it is a great app, and I just got some delivers today and yesterday and they are amazing 😀, and from thousands or even millions to pick from this very app. Keep up the good work Amazon.👍 👏"
4,"The filters and delivery really need to get on par. It is incredibly infuriating needing something asap, applying a filter to try and get it asap, then all the sudden the delivery is now coming later on than what was said."
1,"Can't filter to prime shipping anymore. Please fix, I don't want to sort through all of this garbage that takes 2 weeks to get here"
1,Previous to this update I loved it because I was able to speak what I want to say just by saying it. Now when I get on this new updated version of Amazon shopping the app doesn't allow me to speak what I want to say when I'm searching for items which is ridiculous because I really enjoyed that feature previous to this new update. This is making me not want to shop on here anymore. It's just a big headache I don't have time to type with my fingers I'm always on the go ALWAYS.
5,I love amazon. only problem I have is some things you can't just use in the 30 day return period and get your money back. like we got some escooter tire tubes 2 2 packs and every tire tube we used ended up flat no matter what and it was 4 days after the 30 day return period...so sometimes it's a gamble.... other than that we live amazon and try to review everything because we live off others reviews of stores and products. I'd take amazon over WISH any day!!!!
1,"Sets me back to UK as default, and I have nothing to do or ever want to do with that country. why on f.. earth is there no Irish version or simply EU version? So, ebay, aliexpress it is.."
5,This is my go to shopping online app. What a delight and every time it updayes some more great stuff.....thanjs Amazon!
1,"This app really sucks they deserve a 0 on their search engine, everytime I type an item I need it the search comes with something else it is really annoying and it is so ridiculous how these thing works"
5,"Amazon team members are very polite, straightforward, honest, hands-on, supportive n understand people. They go the extra mile without to much nagging and tension. They will give you a solution or honestly require more time to research the right solution. They are always driven to do more, better,faster..."
1,Amazon needs to have a better delivery service cuz my package that I have been waiting for since Tuesday hasn't shown up yet. I have waited 3 days. It shouldn't take that long to deliver a package. I mean seriously this whole late thing needs to stop. It's making me not want to order anything from Amazon cuz of them delivering super late.
1,"As most buyers, we use our phones to order goods ,the thing is it is too easy to order USED goods without knowing it, amazonn does not highlight or warn buyers about .the ""preowned /used condition"" ,neither makes it easy for buyers to see or find actual pictures of the items posted by the seller , resulting on unfair high return rate on buyers when they find out about Used condition of items. ebay makes it really easy for buyers to see actual pictures of the.item on very first page ."
5,absolutely love Amazon! they have everything I need and want just about. had some difficulties with my package being lost and Amazon was quick to replace and send another product without me having to contact them. awesome customer service
1,"constantly asks to subscribe to prime, it's annoying, I don't want to subscribe to prime, add the option to disable this window using prime"
5,I like shopping on Anazon and they usually meet my needs. I think prices are good and they make shopping easy and convenient.
1,"Did not get the 15€ coupon I was promised. No other reason to use the app, the website is more convenient."
1,"The interface and the arrangement of the product are very very poor in Egypt!! Very few products and very random, it's like walking to a thrift store with everything on top of each other, this is the most unattractive application I've ever seen"
1,"Tired of being unable to use Amazon lockers every time there is some form of Android update. Amazon are always slow to respond to these bugs. Apart from that, it's a pretty good app."
1,"This app is so slow and clumsy, can't scroll through list's, can't view my orders. Even the website is full of issues. When will Amazon sort it's software out it's getting worse."
1,"A complete disaster of an app. Why replace a functional, well designed app with this slow and buggy web view shadow of its former self? Makes no sense. Get someone good at UX on the app team and don't let the penny pinchers run the show."
1,The app is total BS. Everytime I try to see my orders it stays loading and blink/glitches on the same screen! Especially when I am trying to return orders. So stupid. You would think a billion dollar company would be on top of fixing their app bugs.
5,"Has an large selection of hard to find,limited products at your fingertip. Sometimes delivery drivers aren't to careful and precise with delivering to right address ina housing community. I've had a several of my items delivered to a neighbor with same unit number Wrong building Check settings for giving special instructions to lead drivers to the right location."
1,App takes up way too much space. Most of the time the app will give the Uh Oh error message and won't even work. Prime hasn't been worth paying for in years. Prime video is a joke. But they still shove it all down your throat at a higher price. Amazon is 90% cheaply made (yet still over priced) Chinese junk. There's no way this app really has a 4.7 rating...must have Amazon bots working hard on incoherent reviews.
2,Stop moving things in the app!!! Now I can't easily find or use the lists I have saved. Ugh!!!!!
3,The app has its quirks but it works well enough. Though I can't fathom why such a big company can't add a dark mode to their app. Almost every app on my phone has and is set to dark mode except Amazon so I get blinded every time I open the app in the dark.
1,No way to contact customer service directly i received the wrong item and they want me to pay to return it before they will send me the correct item that was ordered or I can double pay for a wrong item this is totally unacceptable been a long time customer and first time I've ever had this much issue very very dissatisfied with the quality of service lately there should be a way to contact customer support within the app but there isn't
3,Well Jeff. You sure mercia'd this one up. Three stars as this was a great product. However it's now in 2019-2022 a cash grab that sells knock offs. Hope this product and patners stop buying islands and start supporting the logistical nightmare that has been created.
5,Love the app I wish there was a way to nickname your cards in the account to make it easier to know which one to use.
1,This app is straight garbage! It won't let me login cause I got a new phone number and when I try to get an email sent it tells me the email is with any account and when I try to make a new account it says the email is in use and customer service won't help either. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
2,"The only reason I give this app 2 stars instead of 1 star is because the website is good and easy to use ,but on the other hand this app completely crashes when when i first signed up or logged in. It first started when i was inputting my currency then the app threw me out of the app and then after I tried coming back to it, it would not let me in the app again!!"
3,"I never used to shop anywhere else! But now the third party sellers with their scams, fake merchandise, poor return policy, and shipping delays make me check Walmart and even target. The charity (smile) domain expires and must be renewed which I forget (probably the intended result). Boo."
3,Recent app update is confusing. Took me forever to find my lists. I liked where it was on the app before the newest update.
1,I'm tired of placing orders and bring told that they're shipped only to get a notification that they need a payment revision and my stuff isn't actually coming!! I ordered birthday invitations for my daughter's party and they won't send them after I paid
1,"Keeps leading me around and around in a circle, making me do the human verification (tried visual and audio verifications) and it congratulates me for being human, and immediately erases the password (no matter what password I suggest), boots me back to the human verification, as though it hadn't just congratulated me for passing the 4 step verification - 4 times in a row. Seriously, F_+* you! And it's not as if the phone is poor quality, or as if I don't know how to use it. No excuse"
1,Worst company when It comes to making an order. Their company messed up and I can't get the issue rectified. In order to make a complaint to headquarters since customer service is not fixing the issue I have spend more money to write a letter and send to a po box in hopes they might respond to fix the issue. This is not the first time I have had an issue with ordering from Amazon. Oh and the actual Vendor is Amazon! Some multi billion dollar company this is! Horrible service❗
5,I love Amazon! There isnt one thing that you cant buy from Amazon besides Hookers lol! But i think it is great!
1,"Locked out of my account for a month, rang customer services a few times from UK and couldn't understand what they were saying, problem still not solved. Not recieving texts from their automated text service and email codes don't work. I've asked Amazon to delete my personal information but they won't? Is that right? Delivery from Amazon is always awful. We have a parcel box 1 step from our front door but come home to parcels piled against the door, items have been stolen. Poor service."
1,Stop changing my currency to Dollars! Seriously Amazon this is the second time the 'Change Currency' option is missing! And I want to see the prices of the items on my list that isn't in Dollars! I don't understand Dollars because I'm not American! Fix this issue please because it's starting to annoy me.
5,"My complaint with amazon is their postage, it's always extra unless you pay X amount of money each month, why can't post & packaging be included in the price just like it is on a similar website."
1,"Do not update on your phone. It now crashes my phone, I can't order or check orders. Online it says I don't exist. Nothing works now!!!! I can't uninstall it, or do anything"
5,"Whenever there's something wrong with my delivery or delay,or have any kind of issue ,they always fix it and compensate me if needed. I do like Amazon a lot., and yes I do recommend."
1,The app constantly goes to USA and dollar for currency! Especially when I had set it up for South Africa. Can you guys work on making this work?
1,"After I've done followed all Amazon procedure I still sm being daily harassed from them. On camera I caught their driver take a picture of my package, marked as delivered and I didn't get the item. There is no such thing as a guaranteed refund through a to z refunds. It's in the small print. I specifically typed "" don't deliver if no signature is obtained "" they want me to file a police report, they blame other carriers for their Amazon mistakes. They mark packages as delivered and often i"
1,"Again , the service is a total mess, every time I order, the system cancel it before delivery .they know nothin about it , they have no explanation, such a loser app"
3,"Good but don't like the new update now, at least add purchase history and stop changing my language to Spanish once in a while 🤔., No bueno! PTM 😂 . For real! Fix it and and this ⭐⭐⭐ will bright a bit more 🌟✨⭐🙂"
1,"Quit crashing! I love using the Amazon app but the last several times I've tried to use it, it will crash. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but to no avail. Please fix this!"
1,"Ok, so, after the disaster Comixology was it seems that Amazon it's following the trend. Amazon, literally, lies about the prices of comic books. On Amazon the selected prices appears as 0$ but you get charged. This is illegal, I thought that I was unlocking free comics but I was charged 60$ for something that I didn't wanted. How many people paid money for something they didn't wanted because they thought it was for free. I didn't expected Amazon to scam people but there it is."
4,"mostly awesome, except for way too many ads within the fire tv experience.. seems like 2 minutes of watching the movie or news, then 3 minutes of ads! so in protest, I've stopped watching!!! get a clue on your*** ""too much time advertising!""*** too many interruptions!!!"
1,"I haven't heard from the those who have created this. Sometimes I can get into the Darker yellow and black, and most if the time I cannot. Since the last lost I have been trusted into offered aps I haven't even accepted. Many times I try get into my android account and it keeps sending me back to blackness. Just like it's doing now, 😞!"
1,"Sure, its a good app, but it is so ANNOYING that i have to get a verification from both an email and a phone number just to make an account. Its really frustrating especially when my phone number doesn't even give me my codes."
1,Looks like this update is really a downgrade. Same goes for many apps these days.
5,"Amazon just randomly gave me free shipping for 24 hours!! All I did was buy some books, lol!! So I bought 2 more books after that! I mean, if it was so I would buy for things it DEFINITELY worked 😂😂 I love Amazon for this, plus it has basically EVERYTHING in one place!! 5/5 !! I probably would have rated it 4/5 but I'm in a good mood and it's 3:29 in the morning soooooo, that too🤷🏻‍♀️"
3,"Can no longer edit existing comments, quantity, and priorities for items on a wish list. When you click to edit, the field is empty, requiring that you start from scratch ! Why, oh why ???!!!"
1,"I have Amazon prime but every other time I open the app it spams me with a ""get prime"" advert that can't be skipped unless I close and reopen. September 2022 update: now they spam a Prime show advert EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP. You can't even close it. Time to uninstall and use the website instead"
1,App is broken. It says everything can't be shipped to my location but when I log in on pc it ships just fine to my address.
2,With the latest update you can no longer filter by seller to avoid all the dropshippers dealing in fakes and rip-offs.
1,To sign in is not made possible the update has made many not able to use this app. They made it harder to find what you want or track what you ordered it's made stupid by incompetent developers they should have left it alone it worked just fine now it's a mess so if you want something your better off going to a store and walking away with the things you wanted pass this horrible app up it's nolonger any good!
1,"My Amazon App was before in English. Now without my consent and without my approval was changed to French. I don't write or read in French. Therefore, this Amazon App is totally useless for me. This is change was done very unprofessional, and it shows Amazon very bad business practice. Amazon App computer software Programmer/Analyst take a note that in Quebec there is more then 60% of Anglophone and Allophones who mostly speak , WRITE and READ English. Alow your clients to choose language."
1,"Scam. I am very disappointed, I order a few items and when the delivery date arrived I got a notice that my items were undeliverable, that was going to take 3-5 days for me to get a refund. I contacted amazon after the 5 days, I was told that they had to have the items for me to get my refund. It has been more than 2 weeks and no word or refund. This is a Huge SCAM!!"
5,I have been using Amazon for most all of my purchases. The App is very easy-to-use and fast. Highly Recommend.
1,Most stupid app ever! no real human to help. I signed up for the 2 times. When I started to order 2nd item they blocked my account because my bank account looked unsual. I live in Spain and Germany with my partner. My bank account is in Spain and I ordered something to deliver to our German home. There were many non-reply automatic emails sent to me requiring me to give a lot of personal documents. Bank statement only has IBAN not Visa #. So they kept sending autoemails. I am so done!!!
1,"Reinstall on Nokia 8V 5G, crashes on opening, insists on installing to storage card, then saying not enough space to move to main memory. PLEASE FIX THIS"
1,Yet again no beta testing before pushing an update. The filter does not hold selections after selected. As I was drilling down using the filter the total never changed. Test test test test. Geeze guys Change Management 101.
1,"Every time I tried to use the app, it shows the message that says something went wrong. Can't use tracking, can't even search for product without seeing the message. Not useable."
3,This app is great! It can some times be disepointing with th updates and loading on to it. It might only be mine
1,App won't show the code I need to access the Amazon locker. I don't get any emails confirming the item was delivered for any item. If you can't get your items they get auto returned. Please fix this.
1,Amazon is a joke they highway rob very body so I was shopping for some outfit on sale now I found outfits the issue the outfit is 99 cents each now I went to buy 3 pairs on Amazon. Amazon wanted to charge me 98.00 for shipping and handling on a 99 cent outfit so in total maybe 5-25 $ for the outfit with tax and shipping would be responsible ut Amazon is a joke they milk money out of people
2,"My orders screen is very glitchy lately, it never loads it's just a blank page so I can't see my orders.... Extremely frustrating"
2,I can't buy clothes off Amazon..I think that's my main complaint..everything is always the wrong size or Asian sized. Most things I go without because there's just too many options and they're all under fraudulent names..why is that? I dont like to be made to feel as if I think of Asian people constantly for using this site..why..because all the shops are made by like fingdinglong...can't buy clothes too many options for stuff you could shop one of..just feel Amazon falls short on value.
3,"Since the latest update I can't view the order page ""oops, something went wrong on our end"" has been the only page I get for well over a week now. I'm not getting items thay say they have been delivered to my mail box and can't track the order if I can't cirw my order page to select the items I need to refund or get replacements for."
1,I have orders randomly vanish from my orders without me canceling them. I have to randomly recover my account often. My billing and shipping addresses seem to change at random as well. Clearly Amazon has a huge security flaw they refuse to take care of.
5,This is so perfect I recently bought an oculus and gaming console and I got the best deals for all from prices low to high I love It!!
4,"I was happy with shopping Amazon But, somehow it's all in Spanish !! I want English !! I may not shop since I can't read Spanish!"
2,It has been working great until this last week or two. The app keeps crashing and it's super frustrating. I can't even browse half the time because it crashes as soon as I open it.
1,I am incredibly angry that amazon has decided to show ads for their shows when you open the shopping app. If I want to browse shows I will open up Prime Video. I don't want to wait for dumb ads to load when I need to browse or shop.
1,"Wow... This app is terrible. I downloaded it 5 minutes ago and all I did was choose a store and then it crashed, and every time I tried to open it afterwards it just crashed every time...???"
1,The app is officially broken and I'm not going to sit around hoping someone says what needs to be said in review. The user face is messed up. I'm signed in and it acts like I'm not. Can't buy anything can't view orders either. Can't add gift cards. Ect. You guys need to find the bug in the system and fix it asap though
1,"I buy multiple things from them EVERY week. They recently took away my ability to review items, even though I did NOT break any of their terms of service. They won't even tell me what I did wrong. I am very upset over this, I take reviewing items seriously and will avoid buying from them from now on. They will be losing about $1,000 a month from me."
5,I love these app easy to navigate and use I have one problem shipping and delivery is too expensive sometimes delivery even cost more than the item I'm buying
1,"Apparently Amazon doesn't believe in Customer Service anymore. There is no one I can call, chat or email to complain about my delivery! The delivery person just left our stuff out on the sidewalk for anyone to grab but in the app claimed they handed it off to a resident, which we and all our neighbors know did not happen! So sick of this lack of customer service from Corporate America! 😡"
2,Why is this app in another language and my other Amazon is it English can you guys fix that problem. I just saw someone else on here reporting the same thing. I don't want it in Spanish I don't know what it's saying and sometimes when I get message sent from others it's in another language as well. please fix this is terrible
4,"It's NOT easy to use this app. If purchasing is a plus, then there should be toll-free phone #'s available at ALL times. Claims Dept needs to hear any problems relating to unreceived items. ( Much trouble in acquiring product & havent rec'd any feedback for purchased items. )"
1,Doesn't work with pixel 4a 5g. Crashes constantly. I have to use the chrome browser. It used to work and startee crashing towards the beginning of 2022 (guess). I check often to see if it's fixed but nope...
1,"Finally had to give in to using online ordering and I got exactly what I expected they did not use the delivery Company I mentioned in my profile, instead they used the worst 4th party delivery available. Now I'm stuck waiting for them to deliver it, literally wasting 8+ hours of my day.... Extremely disappointed in my first Amazon Experience, simple & easy, no damn way it is."
2,"Your search engine is terrible. Please have a look at the eBay search engine, it is far superior to yours and one of the main reasons I go to eBay 1st."
4,"Good app. But Iwould like to be able to change between amazon countries; say between amazon.es (spain) and amazon.de (germany) to buy products from both regions, since international deliver is very easy these days."
3,"App sucks! Glitchy, slow, hurts my eyes cuz images starts tweaking out as I'm scrolling. Half the time when I switch between tabs in the app, I get a white screen and takes forever to load even tho I'm connected to wifi 1gig speeds"
1,"I have a problem with creating an account. While I was making the account, I entered all personal information correctly and got the OTP for verifying my phone number. The OTP didn't work! I retried multiple times before giving up. I have a valid phone # and email. Please help me out so I can fix my review and use your app."
1,I received free year of Amazon with Fios internet last year. It took me FOREVER to talk to someone because I did not want to renew for a full year and wanted monthly payments. She had to cancel the renewL and then told me to set up monthly payments today. I went into manage my payment. I approved my payment method hit continue. IT NEVER GAVE ME A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION SND RENEWED IT FOR A YEAR! found a number to call after googling for the number. Now waiting refund
1,"Contacting Amazon is next to impossible. Then if they don't like your query, they'll pass you on to someone else and eventually cut off your call or your chat - or even deliberately lie to you to get rid of you, as happened to me recently. You never know if items will arrive on time - or at all. They're too wealthy to care, unfortunately. I can't rate the app without rating the company. Too rich to care."
5,"All my life, I have never liked shopping at ""bricks-and-mortar"" establishments: getting dressed to be presentable, commuting, parking hassles, CROWDS---ugh---shopping on Amazon is a godsend; ""try before buy"" with clothing; easy, no charge returns; absolutely ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to be easily found on the Amazon portal and speedily delivered to my door...WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE???!!!"
1,"dont bother trying to get a full refund back, you'll just get half and the rest in BS credit that you have to pay to use."
4,It's a good app but when I scroll through my wishlist it gets so glitchy kinda a pain. I don't know if it's me or the app tho. Edit: 7/24/22 So I'm still having a problem with the glitchy scrolling in my wishlist and it's very annoying I hope they fix this.
2,"Please stop changing this app. Every week it is different and glitchy... I don't recognize any brands on Amazon anymore. They all seem like start up brands or replacement brands with little to no ratings at all. Unless I search specifically filtered products, I don't see much of anything I am familiar with or rated by buyers for reassurance."
2,"Buggy, annoying. Since everything is 4.5 stars, you have to use the comparison widget with ratings split into categories to find quality. Well, it's broken and goes blank as soon as you start scrolling."
1,Doesn't sort low to high anymore? Im looking for shoes and asked it to sort low to high and I got page after page of $100+ shoes
1,App keeps switching to french. Callled tech support they could not help. So annoying. In the passed 6 months app changes from english to french even while im shopping it english i click on cart or something it switches to french. soooo annoying.
1,The full screen Rings of Power ad that pops up everytime I open the app is obnoxious at best.
1,App used to be good but now sux Very slow Pages take forever to load...when they do load For the love of beagles PLEASE somebody fix this app!
3,"Keeps getting stuck, says ""please wait"" or ""close app"", love Amazon but this is frustrating!"
5,"I love Amazon, I get myself things and always get gifts for others from amazon. If your not happy it's easy to return or replace and they give you a lot of time to do it. Amazon has everything you can think up and more, even stuff you never heard of. I highly recommend so give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Use to love this app, now it is a bag of rubbish, small items arrive in massive boxes & arrive damaged get a return that also arrives damaged, when you want to return an item they send the guy out the very next day umm some of us don't have a printer at home as it is 2022 & we work, the returns process is unnecessarily confusing trying to send my returns label to an email to have it printed. Just send it straight to our email address in the first place it's what they are there for. Deleted"
5,it's a good app. It's easy to find what you need and easy to buy. Most of the time the description of the items were on the dot. had some trouble with clothing. Not as described so I would be a bit cautious of that. Other than that all is great.
1,I was forced to download this junk to speak to CS and you can't even get a person to speak to and I am getting tired of amazon letting ppl sell junk instead of what described. I want my refund and I can't even do the return due to being in recovery and it destroyed an expensive item. Really upset and disappointed. Should get the replacement for everything. Can't trust amazon or it's sellers anymore.
1,It keeps crashing and is not delete able on my phone. When I try to use the image search it comes up for 2 seconds then crashes every time. It has all permissions on too.
5,I love everything about it and the shipping is Always on point. Always check size charts and look at shipping dates
1,"Tyrants! I came here to rate the app since 1. Customer service is awful: you should NEVER have to leave an app to Google a link to Customer care 2. My accnt has been banned without notice or explanation from reviewing purchases which I did faithfully apparently for mentioning issues with shipping, packaging and product condition on arrival- all of which customers have a right to know before spending their money. Walmart's less controlling for <$"
3,"Twice in the last 2 weeks, my app has randomly changed from English to Spanish. I don't understand why it's happening."
1,Fix the update. It won't let you search or look at anything.. says oops something happened every time. So aggravating.
1,The app is so slow I barely use it. I don't have any issues except with the Amazon app.
1,Forcing me to watch an ad every time I open the app is an easy way to lose me as a customer. For the foreseeable future I have deleted the app and will only access Amazon in a web browser.
1,"If I could rate lower than one star; I would. I have a problem with an item that I bought from them. I called about it. They literally wiped my account clear of any and all purchases that I have made period. Therefore, I won't be able to address any problems with anything that I have bought from these theives. To hell with Amazon."
3,"The main reason I had this app was to deal with anything I couldn't deal with through my Kindle app. And now I can't buy ebooks books on either, only through the website, which tries to direct me to the app anyway. This is ridiculous, and needs to be fixed."
2,Used to be excellent...now hit and miss. Crashes and/or freezes too often.
1,App keeps closing. Went through the whole process to change password and then I keep getting an error that my device can't be authenticated. Very frustrating.
1,Forced to upgrade app but it doesn't work and I'm being sent in endless circles. So I can't use Amazon anymore despite paying prime
1,The rearrange of the UI is horrendous. The sidebar popout menu was much cleaner a look and feel. This is just clunky and ugly. 1 star for the service of Amazon. Negative 4 stars for awful layout.
1,"Everytime i try to use this app it gives me a dog photo and says ""uh-oh something went wrong on our end"" this has been happening for months and it makes buying stuff from yall way more harder. I think its safe to say shopping from other stores onlone will be easier and ill be able to get my stuff i need"
5,I'm very happy and very pleased with Amazon I've been shopping with Amazon for the last 4 years and it always been Curtis's to anything that I'm concerned about all order and I appreciate that so much thank you
1,I called the and purchased a shaver foil replacement and it was damaged in shipping and no notification was sent . So I had to mentally make note know that Amazon is known for screw ups .so I placed a second order and still no notification so I wonder 🤔 why in the hell I am not getting notifications for this !!!! Where is the item I paid for !!!!
1,"Usually I don't update apps, but ever since I updated this app, my purchase history has disappeared. I've had issues before when products were labled as ""unshipable"" and Amazon tried to not give me my money back, and now I made a purchase on Prime Day last month and the product HASN'T BEEN SHIPPED SINCE!!!"
1,"When clicking an item, the app no longer lets you change within a product to any other versions/variations to view, it only shows the item you first tapped. The website still works so it's an issue with the app."
1,"Keeps freezing, was about to toss my phone in the wall then saw the horrible reviews. Do better AMAZON- Jesus christ paying money for this and getting worse by the day come on!"
1,"What is wrong with the Amazon app??? Hello? Devs? Every item i select to view details, i receive a message saying ""we're sorry... Error. Please reload page. To View item details, add item to Cart."" Yet, even adding it to cart still issues same error!"
1,Trying to modify a baby registry and it freezes and shuts down the app everytime. Extremely frustrating. And then it struggles to load anything else once the baby registry has been access as if the registry is a bug
3,Needs a dark mode feature for visually impaired people and to stop trying to force other Amazon things in my face with we are trying to pay.
5,Somehow the Amazon app has switched to a different country. I can't find any way to change it. Everything I have tried has said ENGLISH . YET I HAVE AMAZON.IN HUMMM HELP!!
4,It's a pretty good app I've gotten a lot of things off of there but be careful ordering things that are not included with prime because when I ordered something that was not included with prime it said it was going to deliver within a month then it said that it was running late and it would deliver within the next week and it never showed up.
5,"I had a very positive experience while using the Map app. I found it to be extremely precision orientational, along with it's photos. Thanks again for the information.!!!!!!!!!"
2,"The app keeps throwing error - We're sorry, an error has occurred. Please reload this page and try again. Clearing cache, stopping the app, reinstalling the app, rebooting device - nothing helps. According to Reddit, it is not a first time"
2,Shipping speed is way down. Went from getting my stuff in 3 days to waiting an entire week. Guess it's back to eBay.
1,PUT THE SORT SECTION BACK LIKE IT WAS. I can't sort high to low anymore and it's frustrating. STOP MESSING WITH WHAT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"2022 update still just as horrible as it always has been. I know I shouldn't have after all my horrible experiences with Amazon I ordered another item and paid to have it to be delivered by 10 pm and guess what it wasn't and noone was willing to refund my shipping or were able when it would now be delivered this ""service"" is horrible the customer service reps are brain dead I canceled the order as well as my prime membership"
1,It's like they don't want any shoppers with this new update. It's terrible. I can't even view what's saved in my cart or scroll without the page refreshing every 5 seconds and taking me back to the top of the page.
1,If your driver gives your packages to total strangers in the street. You'll have a better experience than I had.
1,It's pretty disgusting that you can't even use Google's voice assist and are forced to use Alexa's BS. I mean talk about the total patheticness of Amazon. They charge you money to buy things from them and yet their ego won't even let you use your choice of voice to text. This app is not set up to be user friendly it's set up to try to collect as much cash from you as possible. And they'll let anyone sell on their site no matter how lacking in integrity the seller is.
1,I made an wedding registry through Amazon and all of our gifts got sent to our old address. We contacted the woman who lives at our old house and she said that she told amazon that she was getting all of our gifts but they told her she could keep them. Idk how to add a photo on here but she sent us the screenshot. My husband and I have contacted amazon multiple times over this and they have sent us ONE GIFT from our registry... I feel like all my wedding guests got jipped too.
2,"-App doesn't advance after adding a new credit card, I had to manually go back to the credit card list page and see the new card was added. -There is no option to scan credit cards instead of manually entering their number in -The videos on the review page don't play again when I press the ""play again"" button. -There's no filter for minimum GHz in the CPU when searching for a laptop"
5,"I haven't been with Amazon long.I have ordered from here a few times, and had an excellent experience! Thank you for the speedy and efficient delivery. I sincerely appreciate it. I definitely would recommend this site to others.All my product come as said on the site, and particularly in great shape.I can nearly find anything I need on here and even often cheaper than in stores. Thank you again!"
1,"Horrible customer service, I recently noticed I was being charged for two accounts spent all day with customer service and still not resolved."
3,"They way the handle business with Inyen Vina (IYV Guitar's) is absolutely preposterous and insane. I simply don't understand how or why they only stock/sell only ONE COLOR OF A CERTAIN GUITAR THAT THE COMPANY OBVIOUSLY HAS WAY MORE TO OFFER IN THEIR EBAY SITE. BUT! The shipping is outrageous and unacceptable to a degree.. until you compare with Amazon's LIMITED SUPPLY! Inyen Vina (IYV) has been in the game long run, and established themselves in mfg. instrument's for Top Dog Co. ESP, VINTAGE.."
4,"I love the app but the fact that some accounts do not offer fast shipping and the quotes is a little sad, but overall is a great app"
1,I'm so disappointed I order a zero sugar rockstar September 2 and now is September 6 and is eigth clock and my package is not even here I've been 4 years with Amazon I never have this problem but I'm so disappointed I'm going to delete my account
5,"Perfect for me, very easy to use, maybe a little too easy, spend a bit more than I should sometimes."
1,Why is it every time that I open up the app my microphone icon keeps turning on? Is Amazon now listening to everything in the background regardless if I am using voice search? I have disabled the permission now. Why is it the app consistently full of ad tracking?
2,"The swipe right sensitivity is so annoying, I went to the website. To top it off, there is no swipe left quick gesture, although I can use the back button."
4,"Hey Amazon, I've had a bug in my app for over a month now where my orders just simply will not load. I can't check order status unless I click on the confirmation email. FIX THIS PLEASE BECAUSE IT'S SO F**KING ANNOYING. Thanks so much!"
3,DARK MOOOOODE OPTION. Tired of having the Amazon app burned into my retinas when I look at it for 10 minutes.
1,"I really do not like the changes made in the app, findings orders no longer is even highlighted. Poor UX design as now it takes 4 actions to do what used to load automatically. Wish they would allow people to find existing orders faster not slower."
1,Stuff is cheap but I pay for same day shipping and nothing gets here same day. It's a waste of my time waiting around for nothing.
1,"App messed up after update I just updated the app and it changed itself to usa. I can't use customer service as i am uk based. Can't see any orders or anything. Please fix asap, as I have to but some things before going on holiday, and I can't!!"
1,"Everytime I open the Amazon Prime App, it has automatically changed my preferred language to Spanish. Why is this happening? I don't speak Spanish. I also don't know how to change it back to English, because I don't speak Spanish. My preferred language in my account, when I access it through my laptop, is English. So annoying!"
1,Horrible customer services. I had issue with sync account between my laptop and mobile app after I added Prime membership. Customer services could not tell my any useful information what is happening and after 30 mins call they just hung up. I cancelled prime and all my data sync again. I will never use prime again.
4,"Easy to find what i need. Good thorough info right there before i order. Returns are so well accepted following instructions, of course. Do need to keep an eye on pricing. Can change with the blink of an eye while you are shopping."
1,"Keeps freezing all the time Resets itself when you are in the middle of shopping for something! I used to use it a lot. Now I will do what I should have done from the beginning,use the website!!!!!"
1,"I ordered something I got something different and when I returned it I didn't get my refund back. Worst experience ever, don't use Amazon."
2,"GLITCHY LATELY!! Prior this app was perfect- now very glitchy, takes forever to load or goes blank and closes repeatedly. Have unistalled and re-installed, updated and still no better. A few times I left the site and shopped else where because of it lately. FIX IT!!! PLEASE"
1,"Same as ebay but worse Everything ive chosen same day says out for delivery, then never arives then just says coming late, then next morning, then next evening. And im paying for prime. And usually paying more to get a same day item. Better off with ebays fast and free now. Amazons one up before was not selling low quality items. Now thats almost all they sell Cant beleive its still so large"
1,"You've removed the option to buy ebooks directly from Kindle app, now from Amazon app. I don't get it anymore."
1,"I loved Amazon, great selections. I ordered a book and it never arrived. I called staff & directed to bot. Bot says give seller 48 hrs. Couple days contacted bot again, says not eligible for refund. I shopped on Amazon and thought they backed their sellers. Goodwill was seller in question. Note all: goodwill stock is free donations, then I paid them for book & its shipping. It was not sent or sent to wrong place. Goodwill has stopped my business with Amazon. Learned my lesson."
1,I use this on both my phone and computer but for some reason the 2 have completely diffent prices and the lists I made on computer are not on my phone
2,"Thanks alot for not sending me and my family a message or email when you changed your method of payment timing to when it ships. My family is now in debt due to your new idea. It would have been better if you did nothing Instead of thinking "" oh let's change the method of payment without telling anyone in email or text"". I'm pissed off. My family has worked their asses off to get out of debt and now there back in it. Please at least send an email or something to let people know."
1,You people need to get your act together I paid $18 for a $10 at&t phone card absolutely rediculous every time I purchase it goes up $399 or more I'm going to shut this down!!
2,I would like to know where the buy now option went . This seems more cumbersome to now have to add items to your cart then purchase them
5,Installed in new Chromebook. Was quick and easy and works like it should. No glitches or problems.
1,"Today my Amazon App decided to display ALL in Spanish, I've been trying to change to English, but nothing has worked it is still in Spanish :("
1,"It's fantastic until nothing goes wrong. When I want to contact seller, find out where's seller from within my country or overseas, open message and previous conversations is a nightmare. Please please, everytime I go to see the conversations, honestly I get lost, have to google the steps everytime. It's not at all convenient. Please, I will update my rating once it get fixed. Thanks."
1,"The most recsnt update changes the language EVERY TIME. And now it is in a language i know NOTHING abkut and cant figure out how to change it back. The help menu doesn't help if i can't speak the language lf the prompts, either. I was able to change it when it changed to Spanish and Italian, but now i have no idea what language it is operating in. HELP!"
5,Great and easy to use. So much easier than going onto the web browser all the time!
3,"LET YOUR DRIVERS HAVE AC IN THEIR CAR? TBH, not every time but I have received multiple shipments steaming hot (last thing was face cream and oils).. I tried to give a detailed delivery feedback inside the app but best thing I could do is to select ""other problem"", like how would benefit from my feedback like this??"
1,"App should be trimmed down. Amazon shopping search and filter is awful and makes shopping frustrating. The results include items specifically selected to NOT be in searches. A long time Amazon user, this App has declined into an intrusive data miner and unrelated recommendations..."
1,I hate Amazon now! Amazon is blocking renting movies on Google TV and trying to force consumers to use their app or website for rentals so they can weasel out of paying Google license fees! What a scummy company Amazon had become
2,App no longer displays order history. It gives error. This is very annoying. This started happening after an update months ago and still is not fixed.
4,Generally good but don't waste your time using a pick up locker if you use an older android phone. I spent half an hour in the hot sun with support trying to get the Bluetooth to work with the locker to no avail.
1,"Why is it taking so long for my refund becuase they deemed it undeliverable, they set up customer service so you can't act on anything. You just have to sit back wait and hope they fix the problem without them forgetting about you. It said 3-5 day after your item has been returned you'll recieve your refund. Well its been 4 weeks and still hasn't been returned, no update, no refund, no help from customer service, no nothing. This is frustrating and aggravating because they messed on thier part."
1,Amazon shopping app no longer loads since Aug 10 update. I end up having to use the mobile website instead. Might as well not even bother with this app if it's not functional anymore.
1,"Toyota suite won't connect. States there is a bug in the Amazon Shopping app preventing the pairing. Prompted to clear cache. That didn't help. Uninstalled, restarted phone, installed, restarted phone did not help. Toyota states developer issue with Amazon."
1,"Several updates and years later: Still no long-press functionality (even though it used to have it). Some idiot took it away for no logical or legitimate reason. Still no dark mode, so we get to suffer migraines while shopping. How nice. Amazon seems to prefer moving backward rather than forward. You people are closer to Walmart in intellectual thought than anything. Shame. Congrats on your forever 1. FYG"
1,I payed $135 for a gift card only for my account to get locked for suspicious activity after I signed up for prime. This is ridiculous.
1,"Simply can't delivery product timely anymore. Makes shipment times they can't even COME CLOSE to meeting. Over 90% failure rate on deliveries now. And the app is completely user UNfriendly. Deliver as stated and make your app customer friendly, search function should be a complete embarrassment to them but they keep it??? Not rocket science here. Have a usable app and deliver what you state. They can't do this anymore. Sad."
2,"Changing my review because the last was old and outdated, much like my opinion at the time. Bought a couple cameras that I'm happy with, now my page is full of cameras that I don't need or want. There are other INSANELY useless items on my page, like a freaking 1 person sauna. Also, what the actual flip is a ""driplet twin"" and why am I getting the option to see their picks? How do I turn that feature off. They look like idiots."
1,App sucks. Stuck in French language even though my preferences are set to English. Fix your app
1,"The products, especially the electronics come in bad situation and not as the pictures and description. Moreover, the app itself is very bad to use, the search's results are irrelevant"
5,"Fantastic experience, the updates made a lot of nessecary improvements. This is my primary shopping app, going forward."
5,I have had 98% success shopping through Amazon. Amazon has been very helpful sorting out the other 2%. They have either replaced the item or refunded payment. All representatives have been a pleasure to work with.
1,Forcing me to watch ads for Lord of the Rings before letting me access the actual app is a quick way to get deleted from my phone.
5,"It's so nice, and sometimes you could find cheaper things there instead of like going to target or something."
1,"Keeps switching to French! Very frustrating. I keep having to switch it back to English. Also, some features and instructions are only accessible in French. Tried to get help, almost impossible to find how to chat with someone. Once I finally clicked through all the automated messages and menus and found a chat, waited and waited.... No one there to support. Very disappointed. Very poor customer service for such a huge and profitable company."
5,sure does look good Google very attractive I'm excited to see what offers might be stored upon it looking forward to the holidays and sharing Joy àbound
1,"As of 6/5/2022 I am unable to create reviews or answer questions. They refuse to explain anything as to why and keep sending me to my email, when I am already on Amazon, where it can and should be resolved. They apparently have become inept at best. That's what happens when businesses get outsourced to hodji. After my orders are delivered in June, I will no longer be using Amazon or their inept app ever again. Also they only get one star from me. If it could be no stars it would be."
4,"I love Amazon overall as it makes things easy to purchase and not have to leave the house....that being said I have it listed as ""deliver to back door"" under my delivery instructions and not once has my package been delivered to the back door. I do this to prevent theft as I live in a neighborhood that borders the ghetto so obviously there is going to be theft of packages. So either Amazon drivers are illiterate or they are just lazy or BOTH!"
3,"The mobile number to approve the notification sent to, for my security, is not in service, not for a long time and the preset customer service questions do Not address how to change That number so I can get into my account to pay for the many Subscriptions that can't be paid for... I've been going around in frustrating circles for weeks, I Need to be able to change that very wrong Security Number. Please...Help"
2,Bad security issue: It is obviously not possible to keep kindle login to read ebooks without keeping shopping log-in with permission to spend money!
4,"Amazon! Update your tracker. It's fine if things are running late, but don't tell me it's arriving today when it's 5 states away! Still makes getting into hobbies that where once untouchable, very easy."
5,Love Amazon Shopping. Everything I order is always on time. Their prices are great. So is their Items. Everything I have ordered is perfect. Just like it look on their website. 10 thumbs up.
1,"totally non-functional - I open it and it shifts to a ""uh oh something went wrong"" page. often even on going to Amazon Home, from that page! I can't track my orders or use chat to get help AT ALL."
1,"Absolutely!!!!Hands down; WORST SERVICE available. !!! It has been a nightmare, they charge your credit card, then they lock your account, and make make you jump through hoops to get it unlocked, NO RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS APP. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.."
2,The last update or 2 has busted the app. It will load but then flatly locks up.
1,The app is cool. But the customer service is just plain aweful. I order a product it's supposed to be by me by a certain date. The courier calls me about a week before said date to let me know they can't deliver as my parcel got stolen in a highjacking incident. I contact Amazon they say I must till the delivery date before they can do something. Date comes and goes I contact them. They instead move the date by another 2 weeks even though I keep telling them the courier doesn't have the parcel..
1,"I ordered something that was ships from Georgia to Michigan, thats about two days of driving when you account for traffic. They claimed it would be at my house in three days, a lie. It takes two days to travel here safetly, the order has to be delivered to the post office, this was over a weekend. They wouldnt be able to make it by saturday morning and the usps is closed. So they dropped it off somewhere else sunday, and now its late. Im not upset about the time, just the way you treat drivers."
5,Shopping made simple and if you need to return any items it's free pick up from your home address. Amazon is very good and wipes the floor with ebay. Very trustworthy company and speaking to someone for advice is easy and probably the best there is. Would recommend amazon to all my friends and family.
4,"Sometimes things I buy on here kind of disappoint some items just aren't the same as the description,photo/picture,or they don't do what there intended to do don't get me wrong this app is really good but sometimes you just get ripped-off but not to often other than that it's safe and easy to use al there other apps are great too."
4,"Its awesome but when I do Things such as redeeming a gift card on the website, it doesnt sync with the app."
3,"Feel like I'm getting the run around. Ordered two items, Aug 30. Get a message that package was delayed. Message says is not received by August 6th then I could ask for a refund. Aug 6. Package shows delivered, but no package. Call customer service, says I have to wait till the 7th now for refund. Do they just change the dates on the day you can ask for a refund ?? And why would it say delivered at 3pm if it really wasn't delivered. Prime member too. What good is being a member if orders are"
1,"Amazon can't even maintain and fix basic functions. can't purchase digital music on the app, and searching for digital music is absolutely cancerous. new update? STILL CANT PURCHASE MP3s! 🖕🏽 AMAZON"
1,"Be careful if you pay yearly for prime they will place your account on hold and no one will know why there's a hold and then when you try to talk to someone you'll be told everyday that someone will get back to you in 24 hours and no one ever will then when you call back they say the same, and will keep doing this so you can't use your account and they get the prime payment and you don't get to order! Needed to stop using Amazon anyway hopefully everyone else does soon too"
3,App is rather rudimentary for the state and size of the company. Costumer service in India is probably the only good thing. Deliveries and delivery drivers are a joke and they are the back bone of Amazon. At least you get what you purchased when using it in the UK.
1,Amazon has made so many unauthorized purchases on my card and normally they can be resolved and refunded (which i should not have to do in the first place) but today they made 2 unauthorized purchases and when i called to resolve them i was hung up on twice! I now refuse to buy anything from amazon and they will never receive any money from me again.
1,"Video adverts as I attempt to shop! I didn't think amazon could stoop any lower, bombarded by video ads as I shop yo give them money. Uninstalled."
3,Amazon shopping no longer works properly on my OnePlus 8 5G UW. I no longer get notifications. And most the time it's impossible to look up past orders. And I bought this phone on Amazon. Also having problems on another app. I'm done with OnePlus junk.
1,Amazon sucks azz my packages never come on time it's cones 1 -2 days later which is unacceptable I'd rather go to the brick and mortar stores to buy my stuff from now on.
4,I don't use Amazon often but when I do it has many offers of the item I need from different suppliers. I like the choices I'm given. Prices vary widely on the same product from different suppliers. Still good app.
5,Amazon is the best! They have just about anything u can dream up and deliver it quickly and with care! The updates are so helpful for keeping your packages safe. And the returns and refunds are swift and easy! Absolutely love it and do most of my retail shopping through them now.
3,"Was a good order tracking app, but with the latest update, it stinks. Do not like recent update"
2,"Why, if you search price low to high, do tens of thousands of irrelevant items suddenly appear? Absolutely nuts idea and loses the app 3 stars"
2,"After some use, makes my phine get really hot and I can literally watch my battery dran 1%/min. The phone starts stuttering and everything comes to a screeching halt. It's worse than a game. In short, not really usable."
1,Reading all the reviews I agree with everyone else on here I could write a long one on them their customer service is really bad you can't talk to a live person they got a bot that talks to you and their new site!! it sucks!! And as far as deliveries concerned to be delivered on time it's gotten really bad they do not update you to let you know that it cannot be delivered at this time 13 hours later nothing and it says it's out for delivery. They do not update your delivery
3,"It appears the latest update changed the option to get Amazon Prime in the app. It now says that I can't subscribe to Prime in the mobile app, whereas before I had no trouble at all. So a 5 star review turns into a 3 star one! Change it back!!"
3,The language keep automatically changing back to French no matter how many times I set it to English. I spoke to a customer support representative but the problem never got away. I just don't get why my settings are changing without me doing any action.
1,Stupid app sending me 'deals' five times a day and no way to turn them off. Freakin irritating
1,Used to be a great app. Now I'm forced to use a pc. The orders screen will not load past orders. Just acts like it's refreshing over & over again but never displays any orders. This is a know problem that has been reported for months MANY places online but still hasn't been resolved
1,The delivery process is very slow and delivery boy is not responding they just ignore the msgs and order is not received on given time soo you need to more work on these things otherwise the everything is 👍
1,"I just made an order and while all items were free shipping, they still wanted to charge me $6 for s&h. This kinda goes along with McKenzie Scot's review of her ex-husband and his lack of character. I'll be buying my items on EBay, where they don't scam you."
1,"It was horrible. Order showing as delivered, whereas in reality i did not receive it at all. Was shocked to see the Delivered message! Not even a single call was made to me to confirm the order or address. Extremely annoyed!!!"
5,"Love this app... makes shopping Amazon incredibly easy and it saves and compiles list of things you might be interested in. I've found things I didn't know existed, beautiful things, opened up whole new interest and styles to me."
4,How do I sign up for Prime? It tells you to copy paste in put it in your browser but it just takes you back to Amazon. It use to be so simple to sign up for Prime but now it just gives you the run around. Please tell me how i can sign up for Prime please😔
3,"Amazon refuses to ship TVs/tables or other bulky items to Hofuf even though it's not a remote area and possibly the icon of the Eastern Province. They're too cheap, making prime not worth it much. Also, while you get an OK support and some good prices, most of the deals are fake. Timer to a deal? If it ends, you get the same price via a free coupon anyway. But not allowing screenshots of my checkout which is useful as evidence if something went wrong; that's a horrible decision."
1,Lazy and buggy design. Absolutely infuriating for how massive a Haitian sugarcane operation amazon is. Big evil empires are also efficient come on guys
3,"The app is great, despite a few glitches. The accounts system makes it hard to follow purchases and returns. The Amazon service is still very good but no longer outstanding. Without being a Prime member delivery is poor yet the increase to £8.99/month for this is a bit much when I add up the huge amount I spend with them. I will use them because of their remarkable choice but I will start looking elsewhere, not least to keep other businesses in business."
1,probably the only app that I hate more than Google maps is Amazon shopping. I would rather die in agony than be stuck with this app as my only means of spending my money. it makes me so unhappy I want to throw up on my phone. the developers must not be getting any money because an 8 year old could do better job of coding this puke of garbage.
4,"I would give it a 5 star, only challenge is the consistent crashing of the app when performing certain actions, else really intuitive and great recommendations on alternative products."
3,"It's crazy that it still lacks basic filtering functions - should be able to sort by price per quantity, etc. So many reviews are fraudulent, for the wrong item, etc."
1,Will give 4 stars when you guys finally accept paypal for payment. Not paypal debit but traditional paypal. In fact im canceling prime after this month as well just because I cant use paypal. The way folks get hacked on here it really is needed. Paypal will get our money back for us. It is better business for amazon too. Lets get it done already!
4,"Amazing 👏 service and products. I joined Amazon roughly about 8+years. I can say that they have proven to me time and again to fulfill their end of the contract. Nonetheless, they are not perfect..however, Amazon does try to make it easier for you to bring up concerns regarding your orders or their products or delivery services. I primarily joined the Amazon family because one Christmas I saw 2 individuals fighting over a parking spot. So I drove home and looked at my options & here I am."
5,"Excellent app , Does exactly what you want , Very user friendly , I have never had any problems with this app 10/10"
1,"After the latest update, an annoying and unwanted trailer starts to play at startup. Don't install!"
1,I now have to log into a web browser to be able to purchase books for the kindle app. Can't purchase them through the amazon app OR the kindle app anymore. It's very frustrating to have to have to log into multiple places to make one purchase now.
2,"I used to be the biggest fan of Amazon. Something changed. When I place an order, I am told that the order will be here the next day. Then, when go to check the status of the order, it's now three days out. For that, I could have just gone to the store. It's not as if the pricing is saving me anything. Totally frustrated."
1,I'm changing my reason for this one star review I have ordered several things to Amazon and I keep having this happen Amazon promises a a to z guarantee unfortunately they do not back their own word it's just a lie used to make you feel secure but you're really not
1,"My Xiaomi Redmi 9 keeps disabling this app for no reason, I have no idea why it keeps doing that, I tried everything... it's so annoying."
3,"I've had to reset the app on two separate occassions now, as for some reason the app is failing to display any of my wish lists. It only displays 2 wishlists, and those show up as empty."
2,"What about dark mode. It's over due!!! Also secure, the app should have a pin, password, fingerprint. It would be very secure. Instead of so many useless ads."
2,"This app is now more difficult to navigate than the website so the result is that I will not be using it and I suggest you improve your app, you are getting a lot of upset users!!"
1,"That unskipable ad that has been added on launch is unacceptable considering how much money is paid to Amazon on a regular basis. I'm not even complaining about the normal ads in app or even the prime video ads, but this one is too much"
1,This app sucks. used to work fine. Updated and now it takes a minute per click to open. Uninstalled and reinstalled app and no change. I speculate that what is happening is that Amazon's app has been setup to silently upload my personal data without my consent. I think they are stealing it. When caught they will then lie and give trinkets for raping my privacy That's why I think the app is slow. Prove me wrong Amazon with incontrovertible documentary evidence & I will change review
1,I used to love Amazon and it's customer service but two days ago I have been banned from leaving feedback on my items. I usually love my products and delivery service and like to give positive feedback. I however on Saturday had a delivery left on doorstep in full view when I was in. I gave a thumbs down for the delivery and since then I have had the app change all my previous positive positive feedback and say I'm not allowed to leave feedback anymore.?? I emai customer service who said ok?
1,Still issues with looking at your orders.. this has been like this for months and still not sorted.
1,"Useless. After the design update this app get useless.- Hard to track your order. -My watched items are gone. -Map tracking not working at all. - I hate to use this app. - I try to write to customer service, but they do not care. - I am extremely disappointed."
1,"I already have the other version of this Amazon app installed on my tablet and it works fine, but this appears to be a different version of the Amazon app. I'm not sure how it's different but it keeps saying ""couldn't install"" and it's been stuck there for months and I can't get rid of it from the Play Store."
1,Amazon really needs to pull it together. Delivery agents don't read instructions. Ever.
3,"While dated it was functional, but now just checking simple things is several layers deep in the tabs."
1,app is PAINFULLY sluggish and laggy and just awful to use honestly just opening up amazon in your browser is a better experience
2,"Ever since the app was updated a while back with the menu along the bottom, I've found it's really laggy and clunky. It's not a good user experience."
1,"One of the worst apps ever. Opens Amazon links from Chrome, page loads fine, go to scroll down a bit, get the ""Something went wrong on our end"" Waste of time. Just use Chrome."
1,"I would review the app, but after trying to make a purchase, my account is ""on hold."" Absolute ridiculous."
1,Hate it. As another reviewer mentioned there are problems with freezing and being frustratingly slow. Too many problems to list. This needs to be fixed.
1,"The app always show an error when I select a product (""We're sorry, an error has occurred. Please reload this page and try again."") so I can't order, which makes this app quite useless. I updated to the latest version, no change."
1,"The most unreliable shopping service there is! I keep trying to get cat food from my pets and I pay extra for it to get delivered the same day.. And it still doesn't come for 2,3 days and they don't know where it is or what's going on with it and that's the 3rd time this happens. I don't mind walking to the store but why am I paying the prime membership if I can't get anything delivered on time? Maybe you should ask yourself the same thing"
1,"They're forcing you to go through MULTIPLE rings of power ads before actually being able to go to the store. Don't force me to watch ads, especially if I'm already paying for Prime! Absolutely ridiculous"
2,"This version of the app is extremely bloated and slow. With an annoying Alexa button giving popups on every page, I uninstalled after 20 minutes. Nice work."
1,"""We're currently experiencing longer than normal wait times. We're sorry about this."" Amazon is great when things are right and terrible when they're wrong. I've received this message regardless of the time of day or which device I try. Amazon may be convenient but when your order isn't correct, there can be little recourse."
3,The shopping and app are fine but I wish you would take the money out when we order something versus waiting for days
4,"Excellent customer service, speedy delivery, and easy to return goods are the pros. The cons well the app is problematic at times. Too much fake goods being sold as your forever reading in reviews about it. More so with the designer clothes. And the prices from some sellers there so outrageous a product costing a pound in town being sold for £8.99 on Amazon just beggers beleif. So fix the app stop the fakes and the extortionists."
1,"Caught stealing my money twice. It has now been twice that amazon automatically subscribes my account to prime without telling me. There has been NO interaction from my part to activate prime. Of course now I'll have to shut my mouth because I value my time, my credit card will unfortunately have to be removed and added back for every purchase, I am strongly thinking about changing to another reseller which values his/her costumers a little more but by the state of your employees it tells a lot"
2,"I just want to look up some products, web or app, I don't care. But the app kicked in, then forced me to update. I don't want to bother at this time. App, stop forcing people."
2,"I have this problem with so many apps now. Where is the log out or sign out button?!? I love to check my orders on my phone, but hate staying signed into apps for security reasons. But like so many other apps, this one has become like the Hotel California. Please give users a clear and intuitive way to sign out."
1,"This app is now awful and unusable. Nearly always get a ""whhops something happened on our end error"" when viewing any item. Pages don't refresh. Something major broke w this app. You would think with the billions of $ Amazon has that they could build an app."
1,App is horrible it won't let me into my account keeps saying that my password is incorrect and keeps sending me an email saying someone is trying to get into my account yes it is it's me trying to access my account Smdh
5,Love the fact that I am able to use my snap benefits and even get my groceries delivered to me for free! It's nice to finally have an option other than either struggle my way onto the bus with enough groceries to last longer than 2 days. Or have to go buy groceries almost every day.
2,Absolutely hate the ad that pops up immediately upon opening the app. I don't care how short it is. We are bombarded with Amazon ads everywhere online as it is and now we're forced to see yet another ad when we voluntarily open the ap? When is it enough?
1,This app is getting worse and worse! Freezing on pages. Errors when trying to load the orders page or the lists page. You guys need to fix this or you'll be losing alot of customers.
1,Useless lately like they took the pandemic as a excuse to not do update or fix anything that's wrong. Same with prime video
1,"Terrible, my package was late got no information on where is was and then had to download this app to contact someone, none of my orders appeared on the app. It's incredibly slow and when I finally got in touch with someone on the app it wouldn't let me type and crashed"
1,Please add a DARK THEME option. The blazing white hurts my eyes when every other major app has added option of dark theme. It's been literally YEARS now.
4,"They are good to order from, there merchandise is usually of good quality & their customer service rep's are normally friendly & helpful. I plan to continue shopping at Amazon because it's life made a little easier & that makes me happy. RC"
3,"I mean, it's Amazon so whatever. It would be really cool if you could have multiple carts though."
1,"Tracking is terrible, 2 orders now gone wrong first one delivered to an address 3 streets away 2nd order not delivered and customer services is really poor and does not take ownership of issue and say wait 48 hours as it might get delivered."
1,Amazon is cheater. As a amazon seller I gave 18 items to sale and when I asked to return the item they provided me only 17. In India customer service 🐕‍🦺 level is pathetic.
1,The last upgrade slooowed the app down noticeably -- I hope this one speeds it up much more! I can't understand why ANY upgrade would slow [it] down other than bloating it up with SO much unnecessary *flibble-flabble. (*new word!)
5,I love ordering from Amazon whether it's buying something new or something I'm looking for their products are always great their return rules are great they always replace your items if there's something wrong with them they never really give you a problem I really enjoy trying everything from Amazon
1,Stop showing me ads for new Lord of the rings upon opening. I do not appreciate even a 10ms delay. Make it fast for shopping.
5,"Amazon ismy go to place to buy. They always have everything I need. I should have stock (LOL) in Amazon for how many, many things I purchased from them. Amazon has saved me from traveling to the stores. I use them for Christmas, birthdays, and other occasions. They are absolutely 💯 😍"
2,The Amazon app is doing well for me but I believe the people that are at the Amazon customer service are horrible. I've been getting a lot of packages that I did not order and then they expect me to send them back or I have to pay for them just to get the package that I wanted first. And then I have to call people in a different country just to get what I ordered and them trying to send me in a whole roundabout just to get my item purchased. Wake up Amazon. You have a problem.
1,"The day when Amazon was the one stop shop for everything has long gone. So has the competitive pricing and customer service. Welcome the the new age of miss representation, overpricing and nothing but cheap Chi.... rubbish."
5,I love the convenience. Never have any problems come up to ruin the experience. Now with the blessing of getting so much online it saves me shopping which is too difficult for me.
1,"Won't open without a full screen advert for rings of power, I pay for prime I do not expect my experience to be ad supported!"
4,"Webpage is better, even using the phone browser because the app lags a lot of the time which is a bummer cause the app would be nice to use more often but it takes too long to do things. At least for me i need quickness and fast browsing so since i can't just breeze thru and buy buy buy like i like I'm only able to do 4 star"
1,"Difficult and time-consuming to navigate, like trying to find out what to do when you order a needle and end up with the haystack. I don't have time to package it, loaded up and take it somewhere to ship it back! Just send your truck out and take it. Once you download this app you can't go back!"
2,Good app but bug with with Orders. The recent orders tab will just hang when trying to load up my latest orders Edit... Still hanging as of 19/10/22
1,"Every time i happen to order a gift i get unlucky enough for Prime to decide to ship with FedEx or USPS, the two WORST carriers. FedEx likes to just drop off to USPS and have them delver. The Ohio Usps facility always loses packages and the Louisville KY hub just decides to deliver whenever they feel like getting to it. STOP USING THESE CARRIERS WITH PRIME MEMBERS. I dont want refunds i want the items i freakin ordered.🤬"
1,"Some of the worst customer service I've ever had. If talking to a human was an actual option, maybe some problems could be solved. But it's all robots. Dumb robots that don't understand such a simple concept as my package was delivered to the WRONG HOUSE, but they'll do nothing to fix it."
4,"Navigation could be more user friendly. The app isn't what I have a problem with, it's the fact that they send an email the day after you receive the package. My goodness give a person a chance to use it before asking for a review."
1,Getting worse. Now 'watch lists' no longer show used prices. You have to click each individual item to bring up lowest prices for anything used. Website still works.
1,I created an account and ordered it you guys sent me an email confirming my password was ok. Now when I put in my telephone number it says it belongs to another.Also when I go to log out it does not log me out. That means anyone can log in because it remains open your app is difficult to navigate and it's he frustrating just trying to find what you have ordered.
1,"Delivery drivers ignore delivery instructions. No way to contact amazon. Then they keep your momey for 5 extra days to ""ensure delivery"" before they give you a refund. Ive had packages left in the rain, my mailbox (notified postmaster general), on the bumper of my truck (didnt see that one until i ran over it). Granted fedex isnt much better, but they are better. Quit trying to be a delivery service. You suck at it."
3,"Great app, but missing the all important dark mode. It is 2022, no app should be missing dark mode!"
3,"Oh God, does it suck to shop here. Hard to compare items or find consistent listing between competing brands."
