## Description

Sentiment analysis is a process that helps people understand how other people feel about things like products, services, or even healthcare. It uses computers to analyze things like social media posts, reviews, and surveys to figure out if people have positive or negative opinions. This information can help businesses make better decisions and improve customer experiences. Sentiment analysis is also becoming important in healthcare because it can help identify when patients are feeling down or struggling with mental health issues.

## Problem Statement

Amazon is a huge company and want to know what is the opinion or sentiment of their customers about their app. They want to use the google play store reviews data, to make their platform user friendly and minimize the bugs users are getting frequently.
